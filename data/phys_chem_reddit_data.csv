Physics,"Hi everyone,

I'm a bit weird and always seem to like doing things that aren't very promising financially. For example, I went into my current physics program (undergraduate, BSc) with the intention of double-majoring in either political science (BA) or economics (BA or BSc depending on which concentrations). I've been in loose but regular contact with a political science professor at a bigger school who is looking for physicists to help him better formulate theories around political and economic behavior patterns, and he's told me I should apply for his PhD program when I'm done. I guess my motivation for physics wasn't the typical one. I went into it more or less because I thought it would be an excellent approach to describing chaotic systems, like those found in politics and economics, and not necessarily because I wanted to better understand light or gravitational forces. 

Now, I'm into the first half of my junior year, I'm still holding a 4.0 GPA, but I'm stressed out and unsure about what to do. I don't know if my thinking is correct or not, and I'm not sure if I'm making good choices in my academic pursuits. To be honest, watching the economy implode around me has scared me more than I thought it would. Thoughts have started to persistently come up about being employable, having marketable skills, being ""useful"" etc. Fears of homelessness, poverty, etc. are more noticable. 

Because of these fears, and because my interersts aren't just constrained to pure physics (whatever that is, but I think you understand), I have been really back and forth about whether or not to switch from the physics + social science double-major and go into the BSc in data science offered by my school. 

So, being unsure, and being restricted to online coursework only, I kind of wanted to try out ""everything"": I enrolled in 20 credit hours, taking prerequisites for several majors and also two physics-relevant courses: mathematical methods for physics and classical mechanics. As of now, I have my foot still in the door to the physics major, but also potentially to a political science, economics and the data science major. 

The data science relevant course this semester is ""fundamentals in programming and problem solving"" except that it's really an intense Java course. It's my first time being exposed to programming at this level, and I'm stressed because I've never seen my grade drop so quickly and a minimum of a ""C-"" is needed to get into the upper-level courses relevant to the data science degree. This course is devouring a lot more time than I thought it would, and it's not really teaching ""fundamentals,"" but really throwing us into cold water with Java and some very difficult programming labs, several of which I've simply had to take a 0 on. 

I've strongly considered dropping the course, but I would then also loose that access to the data science degree. And I had considered switching to that degree for multiple reasons:

\- In all my other areas of interest - physics, political science and economics - data is collected and statistically analyzed. I thought if I were to get a degree in data science, I could have a broader array of choices in what I'd like to research later (I hope to stay in academics). I was concerned physics might constrain me too much.

\- I have also been worried about making a living later, and I have gotten into the thought-loop cycles of ""data science is more tech, and tech is more financially secure.""

&amp;#x200B;

I suppose I am looking for a way to know that I could have a plan B with whatever I academically pursue. The data science degree seems to offer more of a plan B than the physics degree, but then I wouldn't be learning so much about the dynamics of nature. I would be more constrained to stats and programming. If I knew I could follow my passions of thinking about ""the big picture,"" dynamic systems in their entirety (physics, economics, politics), and learn the data science stuff on the side as tools of the trade, so as to have tools for some job later if I need it, I would be much more relaxed and happy. I would drop this programming course to which I'm currently clinging out of fear that I would be safer with the data science degree. 

I'd be very grateful for any input, thoughts or just descriptions of similar experiences. If anyone can elaborate on the outlook of data science jobs and physics degrees, that would be great, too. I know that HR departments like labels, and so I worry that having ""data science"" on the degree would make life easier than having ""physics"" on the degree, but I also want to make sure I don't give up on my passions out of fear when it wouldn't have been necessary.

Topic: Law of Conservation of Momentum

Question: A 1 kg ball moving in some direction at 8 m/sec hits a 4 kg ball moving at 6 m/sec in the same direction. Assume that 1 kg ball stops after collision. What will be the velocity, after collision, of the 4 kg ball if the 1 kg ball stops?

10 m/sec

0 m/sec

8 m/sec

12 m/sec

Solution:

Before solving this question, we request you to kindly subscribe our YouTube Channel “Empower Academy Pak”.

Thanks in advance.

We all have studied the Law of Conservation of Momentum which states that the total linear momentum of an isolated system remains constant.

Let’s suppose two balls having mass 1 kg and 4 kg moving at 8 m/sec and 6 m/sec, respectively. Initially the ball of 1 kg have momentum of 8 kg m/sec and ball of 4 kg will have momentum of 24 kg m/sec.

Given Data:

m₁ = 1 kg

Oval: m₂

4 kgv₁ = 8 m/sec

Right Arrow: v₂ = 8 m/secRight Arrow: v₁ = 8 m/secOval: m₁

1 kgm₂ = 4 kg

v₂ = 6 m/sec

p₁ = m₁ v₁

= (1 kg) x (8 m/sec)

= 8 kg m/sec

p₂ = m₂ v₂

= (4 kg) x (6 m/sec)

= 24 kg m/sec

When these balls will collide with each other, there will be change in the velocities of these ball. Therefore the momentum of these two balls will change but according to law of conservation of momentum, total initial momentum of the system before collision is equal to the total final momentum of the system after collision. Which means:

p₁ + p₂ = p₁′ + p₂′…………….(i)

As we know that after collision

v₁′ = 0 m/sec

v₂′ = ?

so, we can say that

p₁′ = m₁ v₁′ = (1 kg x 0 m/sec) = 0 kg m/sec

p₂′ = m₂ v₂′ = (4 kg x v₂′)

Now, using relation (i)

p₁ + p₂ = p₁′ + p₂′

(8 kg m/sec) + (24 kg m/sec) = 0 kg m/sec + (4 kg x v₂′)

32 kg m/sec = (4 kg x v₂′)

v₂′ = (32 kg m/sec) / (4 kg)

v₂′ = 8 m/sec

Hence, the correct option is ‘C’ i.e. 8 m/sec

If you have any confusion relating to this Numerical you can ask us in the comment section.

I got an idea, what if dark energy / matter is gravity, only it is chaotic and the sides are moving at once. But if you put something ""normal"" in it, then it starts to act in one direction, twisting similar to the movement of electrons and generating the gravity that we know. Indeed, due to the effect of dark energy on galaxies, they move away from each other, maybe because the energy is not directed and pushes everything around.

Physics,"A question was asked by a person at a forum and some physics experts tried to answer this question. This blog contains the question and answers of those experts so you can also enhance your understanding and knowledge about the spooky action.

The question was asked that in physics there's no magic but why is spooky action at an infinity distance so real?

These were the answers and discussion between the experts.

ANSWER 1:

It's something misunderstood even by some physicists....ie. an electron isn't some physical object, but rather it's simply an uncollapsed wave of infinite probability. Prior to a conscious measurement or observation it exists neither here nor there. It is in essence at any and all probable positions within whatever system to which it belongs.

Physics,"I talked to someone about some hallucinations I had, when I saw a woman that wasn't there, and they said I wasn't hallucinating and that it could have something to do with multiverse and parallel universes. That ""there is a lot of solid science supporting the idea of a multiverse"", and that it could be universes overlapping and what I saw was from another universe and actually didn't belong into our universe. 

They said; 

&gt;What you saw could be just regular people in a different universe. Either unaware of it, or doing it intentionally - like maybe people in some universe figured out how to interact with other universes and certain individuals use the knowledge to fuck around and mess with us.   
&gt;  
&gt;As for the multiverse theory, there actually is a more recent interpretation of QM called ""many interacting worlds"" which could support this idea (but more research needs to be done as of now). It differs from ""many worlds"" in that it suggests the universes interact on the quantum level. Maybe that can translate into the macroscopic world somehow. Once QM and general relativity are united, we'll know if that's possible or nah. 

Multiverse says there are many other universes. Many articles on google support the idea of multiverse, for instance this article says there is evidence for the multiverse and parallel universes; [https://www.space.com/32728-parallel-universes.html](https://www.space.com/32728-parallel-universes.html)

&gt;There are [at least five theories why a multiverse is possible](https://www.space.com/18811-multiple-universes-5-theories.html), as a 2012 Space.com article explained: [https://www.space.com/18811-multiple-universes-5-theories.html](https://www.space.com/18811-multiple-universes-5-theories.html)  
&gt;  
&gt;1) **Infinite universes**. We don't know what the shape of space-time is exactly. One prominent theory is that it is flat and goes on forever. This would present the possibility of many universes being out there. But with that topic in mind, it's possible that universes can start repeating themselves. That's because particles can only be put together in so many ways. More about that in a moment.   
&gt;  
&gt;2) **Bubble universes**. Another theory for multiple universes comes from ""eternal inflation."" Based on research from [Tufts University cosmologist Alexander Vilenkin](http://now.tufts.edu/articles/beginning-was-beginning), when looking at space-time as a whole, some areas of space stop inflating like the Big Bang inflated our own universe. Others, however, will keep getting larger. So if we picture our own universe as a bubble, it is sitting in a network of bubble universes of space. What's interesting about this theory is the other universes could have very different laws of physics than our own, since they are not linked.   
&gt;  
&gt;...

Physics,"Hi, 

This might be a simple problem and this subreddit might not be right place to ask so if someone points me in right direction I will be grateful because I am confused where to ask this question. 

I am looking at two particles moving in fluid through a microscope and I am tracking them in 3D space via an algorithm based on perspective projections and computer vision. I have their 3D position available at all instance in time. 
Issue occurs when these particles get really close to each other. Their images appear to be one particle for few time steps due to diffraction limit. So trajectories I get for two particles are passing through each other which is not physically possible.  

I have particle shape information available in-form of Quadrics in 3D space. I want to figure out a method where I solve for particle locations constrained to their body size so that I can get better estimation of those time steps where I could not tell them apart. I have 40 data points where both particle have distinct positions and 3-4 times steps where both particle occupy same spot. I am basically trying to solve for those 3-4 time steps so I get distinct positions for that also. One idea would be to naively fit 2nd or 3rd order polynomial through their mid points but again it will still get them too close to each other where their body’s will be overlapping so that is not an option.

Hola, Astro-geeks! Following our successful webinar with Dr. RV Ramanan, we are back with another episode of the ""Primus 2020"" series.  
Have you ever pondered over questions like how stars are born and how they die, why the Earth is rocky, but Jupiter is gaseous, why Alpha Centauri is a triple star system, but our solar system is a single star system and many such questions?  
From ancient times various civilizations have come up with different explanations of how stars and planets have formed. But it has taken us thousands of years to come up with theories that can explain their formation satisfactorily.   
Thus, to put an end on all our curiosities, we are delighted to introduce ""Dr. Jessy Jose"" from IISER, Tirupati, for the 2nd episode of ""Primus 2020"" titled ""Star &amp; Planet Formation - A brief overview.""  
Dr. Jessy Jose is currently an Assistant Professor at the Indian Institute of Science Education and Research (IISER), Tirupati. She has authored many research papers on the topics related to star systems formation, which have also been published in the Astrophysics Journal by the Royal Astronomical Society. She has also been awarded the ""Outstanding Post-Doctoral Fellow"" by Peking University in 2016.  
We feel very honored to have her among us, and we heartily invite you all to be a part of our excitement as well. Be ready this 19th September at 1900 hours (IST) to dive into the history and future of sparkling stars.

So here's the deal with me. I'm an undergraduate in my final year. I've been doing research for years, I'm majoring in physics and math with a minor in astronomy, I lead science clubs on campus, and I generally love physics. When I'm not studying or doing school related work (which is rare since I work maybe \~80 hours per week on it), I'll watch physics or math videos on YouTube. I have my name on important papers and give a talk at a major physics conferences. Despite this, my GPA isn't that great, with my major GPA being around a 3.7. I talked with my research mentor, and he's told me that when applying for grad schools anything above a ranking of about 50 is going to be a hard reach.

I know that not everyone gets to go to the best schools, I know that schools ranked 50-75 or so aren't that bad, but my entire life for the past number of years has been nonstop academia. I've put in all this effort, had sleepless nights and constant anxiety attacks, had numerous times where I'd break down and start crying because of the stress, and *this* is what I have to show for it? A below average GPA that's not going to get me into any good schools? 

At this point, I just feel like I don't deserve to be in physics. Like I'm not good enough for the subject. Honestly, I don't even feel like I deserve to *enjoy* physics or math, if that makes sense. This isn't impostor syndrome. I know what that feels like, and this isn't it.

Physics,"(I am aware this post is might be better suited for r/AskPhysics but it didn't get much attention there so that's why I'm trying here. Any suggestions for books, lectures, anything are very welcome.)

I have always have had an interest in the theoretical side of physics, however, in this world we live in it seems that it would be better to apply myself to the energy transition rather than string theory. This is  why I study applied physics (and mathematics) rather than theoretical physics. I have however still a deep interest in a particular problem, the sixth problem proposed by Hilbert more than a century ago: that of an axiomatic basis to physics (so basically a complete and rigorous mathematical system that deduces all of physics from a few principles).

All  I ever wanted in my physics education was a way of understanding and  making approachable the totality of physics, in the way mathematics is.  It is very clear how the subjects stack on top of each other, which  makes it a lot easier to learn. Physics feels less orderly. To solve this problem, I want to write a book in which I explain *the physics* (sorry if this is beginning to sound like a shitpost, I'm serious). A book in which I  apply the geometrical method (like in Euclid's Elements) to physics.

Now I don't believe I'll solve all of it, but I want to give it my best shot. From what I've understood I'll need quantum field theory and general relativity, and probably string theory. I know mechanics  (Newtonian not Lagrangian), electrodynamics, statistical physics and the basics of quantum mechanics and special relativity. I know that Leonard Susskind's courses are on YouTube and the titles of the videos give me  the impression that they contain all I need, but before I spend 300 hours watching them I first wanted to consult with the wise people of reddit.

Physics,"Goodmorning everyone.
I'm just an high school students, so my understanting of physics is very basic.
Anyway, I thought about one thing.
I've been told by my teachers that the speed of sound in a certain material grows as grows the density of the material itself.
I've also been told that the opposite happens with light( I mean, it reaches it's maximum when the density of the material that it is going through is quite zero)
So I asked myself, is there such a dense material in which the speed of sound is higher than the speed of light in the given material?

However, I remember when I first joined college (I came from a rundown high school) I wanted to study physics and chemistry to understand the universe to its depths. My inspirations were Big Bang Theory and many superhero movies of which I watched since I was a kid. 

So in my juniors I took chemistry (voluntarily). I will be perfectly honest. I passed the class with an A- but I didn’t learn anything. The class was more math than how or why. I wanted to genuinely learn on why we actually do these things but I felt like I was just taking a math class again. I was never more disappointed.

In addition, the professor was extremely rude and found my questions as to the “how or why” just irrelevant. He would always respond “just follow the formula”. 

After which I was turned off from chemistry. I’ve never been more disappointed, over something such as this. Something I wanted to learn and understand since I was young was just another boring subject that’s just shoved in my face. 

Now I understand this subreddit is for physics so here comes the question. I have still failed to learn physics (given I have not taken the class yet). So I want to genuinely learn it myself. I’m just too frightened to take it with a professor or instructor that would do the same my chemistry professor did by making the class seem more mandatory (although it somewhat is) over it being passionate.

Physics,"Hello fellow physics lovers. I'm here to provide my understanding of Black Holes, and the Universe, and since my knowledge is very limited, since I can't properly do the maths since my field isn't exactly physics, I want your valuable opinion. 

So for starters, I don't believe black holes are portals or holes to other dimensions or weird stuff like that. I believe in Hawking's theory that they are singularities. However, the definition of a singularity is that it's infinitely dense, which I believe is a misinterpretation. I believe a singularity has maximum\* density. What I mean is, we know that atoms are made up of protons, neutrons and electrons, and that most of the volume that makes up an atom, is 99.9% empty space, so what I think is that a black hole is something without empty space, and that everything that comes in it's gravitational boundaries, gets pulled into that same state of no empty space. I would like to calculate that by using the volume of a single proton, however, that is not possible, the most that's currently known is the radius charge of a proton, not it's actual solid volume ( from my research at least). 

That's my understanding of the black hole, now for the universe, it's a bit tricky, and I hope you can understand my reasoning. So before a few months ago, I always imagined our physical universe, as having a limit, that from math and observations we know that it's expanding, so I always thought that the universe was like a growing bubble, inside the bubble we have matter as we know it, stars, planets, galaxies and so on, and I imagined that outside it, it was infinite empty space, maybe  just quantum fluctuations, but that's besides my point. However, reading Hawking's theory that previously to the big bang our universe was a singularity, that every solid that exists inside our universe was condenced to a single point, and after getting too much energy concentrated in it, it exploded and got to how it is now. However, I believe it's different, I believe that before the big bang, everything was a singularity, not just a single point, I mean, maybe even before the actual big bang, but originally, I imagine that everything was just matter, no empty space, no vaccum, no radiation, no electric-magnetism. So once the big bang happened, for the first time, there was vacuum, which led to the production of different types of mass, like protons, electrons, with spin due to the explosion, and then all the universe began. So now I believe, that outside our physical universe, is just more singularities, with infinite mass, to the infinite. Which would also explain why some scientists believe in multiple universes, and multiple big bangs happenning right now, since there's infinite singularities outside our universe, it makes sense that more of these explosions, and bubbles would form. 

Now you probably ask, if everything at the begginning was all mass, and stable, why was there too much energy at that single point to provoke the big bang. Well I also believe that in a state of perfect symmetry, our universe always tends to become asymmetric, which would lead to the big bang, since in a space with maximum density, there can't be a point with more density, so it would explode.

I do however, don't understand why the universe keeps expanding, or where quantum fluctuations come into play in this type of thinking. I think the answer to that is what vaccum, or the ""paper"" where mass exists, actually is, but since I don't know where to go from here.

Physics,"Hello, I love to study physics, and the universe. However, I am a novice, and this is just a rough idea. Please keep this in mind, I have no way of verifying anything I am saying, and I could be very wrong.  


Its always bothered me that the theories I have studied don't give an explanation as to what gives rise to the properties they're describing. All of these theories are describing phenomena that occur due to emergent behaviors of something that is going on at a smaller scale.

  
So I constructed a crude TOE that explains how things could gain properties through relativistic interactions, why gravity works without particles, and how time/space constants remain fixed. 

  
In short, all phenomena are emergent behaviors of the basic interactions of space, which are self definition and not-self definition. 

  
Consider that consciousness is the only thing that can create itself, and in is most simple form, it is a self defining loop, (I am X not Y, X not Y....\~). It wouldn't have a beginning or end, it would just cycle data in a loop.

  
Now imagine a conscious point, or CP, that cycles between knowing what it is, and knowing what it isn't (=x, x!=y). In simple terms, its an equal/not equal operator that cycles between these two states. The rate at which it moves between these two operators could not be defined by itself, and could only be judged by another CP.  So if CP-1 ticks twice for every tick of CP-2, CP-2 would operate slower than CP-1 (relativistic time).

  
In order to get the emergent behavior we know as time, you have to have points of space that operate at different tick rates. This removes the issue of infinite regression (turtles falling together vs turtles standing on turtles standing on turtles...). When two points operate at the same frequency, they can interact. This is why spacetime operates in a relativistic way.

  
So if I want an interaction, two CPs must be ""ticking"" at the same, or harmonious base rates. The tick rate of a point is defined by the amount of data it has to be aware of, so if X = abc123 vs x = 1, it will have more to look at to define itself, to call, and therefore a longer tick rate to complete a self cycle. To get a rough idea of this, say "" I am X"" out loud, and then say ""I am X Y Z"" out loud. In the first case, you complete your cycle, and your environment gets the data from you much faster. In the second case, it takes longer for the information to be completed by you, and for it to be broadcast to your environment. There is the base operation speed (the rate at which you can speak), and the rate at which the data you broadcast is completed (words vs a sentence, letters vs words, etc.).   


If CP-A=a!b, and CP-B=b!ac, then CP-A will equal A, AB, A, AB as it cycles, because CP-B will only return once for every two cycles of A. Therefore, ""B"" will appear to have less ""energy"" because it interacts less.   


This is why objects in ""gravity wells"" operate slower than the surrounding space, and have less ""energy"". This is why atoms loose energy when they share an electron. They operate slower, so even if they should have more energy, they cannot interact with the surrounding space, and therefore have relatively less energy.   


Its not a function of a particle or wave, but a function of the rate at which the smallest point possible can interact with its environment, and self. A particle is a point of space that is fully defined, a wave is an undefined, uncompleted ""I AM"" loop.  


A thing doesn't exist until it can define itself, and define what it isn't. Therefore, gravity is an emergent phenomena of the most basic possible interaction, an =, != operator.

The size of a thing is determined by the amount of ""data"" or energy it must cycle in order to define itself. Time slows down when you have more ""data"" because it takes longer for the CP to define it, and broadcast it. Timespace slows down as there's more to be aware of, until it slows down so much that it cannot return data fast enough to outpace the new data it is receiving. It is still ticking, and can by chance interact with the outside, which is what causes hawking radiation.  


This also explains entanglement, because if you can keep two points entangled, then observe them,  you get A!=B, B!=A. Distance is like popcorn popping, filling up a bag (another great picture is a zygote dividing for the firs time). As the points self and other define, they form a web of interaction that naturally creates ""distance"" as data has to hop between more points, and therefore is further away like echos down a canyon. Entanglement is a process of tricking space into thinking its distance is shorter by manipulating the ""I am, I am not"" function, which is relativistic, and therefore doesn't have ""distance"" as part of its operation.   


The effect of data on a CP would decrease in a logarithmic pattern in all directions, like popcorn. CP's that harmonize would create the same emergent behavior, creating fields. Therefore, the rate at which the base CP tick completes itself defines the field it creates, and the interactions it can have.

Physics,"Hi everyone,

I'm an ECE student who recently took an Electromagnetism course. We used Griffiths textbook, and went as far as chapter 6 or so i.e. we didn't cover waves, we cover waves next year. I've stuggled with some huge personal issues this year and I basically had to self teach seven exams as a result. Before I could even start EM, I had to cover partial differentiation, vector calculus, surface &amp; line integrals etc. As a result, I found myself in a position where I had two weeks to learn the course.

Regardless, I find myself struggling with EM. In particular, I don't think the book we used on Vector Calculus was anywhere near sufficient. I also know fuck all about polar coordinate systems and vector transformations. I'm trying to self teach the required mathematics to a better degree than my Engineering Maths book did. I start waves in about a month and so I don't have much time. I need to catch up quickly.

I have ""div, grad, curl and all that"" but I still think I need some deeper treatment of the maths mentioned above (particularly transformations and polar co-ordinates). I also have ""Calculus"" by Thomas - which seems to be a decent book - but I'm not sure if I've enough time to teach the 600 pages or so covering PD &amp; Vec Calculus. I also still need a ground up teaching of polar co-ordinates.

Any advice is really appreciated. As a disclaimer, I have used Google but I need something that goes deep into the topics while still being short enough to cover in the 1 month timeframe.",Struggling with Electromagnetism - maths prerequisites?,1599566581

Physics,"I'm a layman computer programmer / game designer with a huge interest in physics.  I have a theory which would provide an intuitive answer to why MOND could exist.  I hope you might humor me and let me know what you think of my theory.

I suppose there are many potential ways to adjust Newton's gravitational equation, but a simple one I heard about recently says G \~ 1/r\^2 over interstellar distances, but G \~ 1/r over (larger) galactic distances. I thought of a reasonable justification for why this could be... 

**What if gravitons (the force-carrying particles for gravity) were also affected by gravity?** 

Then, they would spread out like puddle waves, so the force of gravity in galaxies would fall off as \~ 1/r over large distances, since galaxies are roughly flat. This would be a reasonable explanation for a reason behind MOND.

So the ""MOND Effect"" would essentially amount to emergent properties of gravitons being affected by gravity.  Can it be tested?

Luckily, this is an easily-testable theory.

The silver bullet: the 19 galaxies that have been discovered that are missing dark matter.  Does that prove dark matter?  Remember they're small galaxies. ""Recently, however, researchers have found that certain small galaxies, now including these 19, behave as if they're dominated by baryons — the particles that make up ordinary matter."" THIS ACTUALLY CONFIRMS MY THEORY. A galaxy would have to be sufficiently flat and sufficiently massive for the ""MOND Effect"" (1/r\^2 becoming 1/r) to take place, thus this effect should be missing in small or non-flat galaxies. [https://www.space.com/19-galaxies-missing-dark-matter.html](https://www.space.com/19-galaxies-missing-dark-matter.html) 

Now gravitons have not yet been discovered, yet there is ample reason to believe they exist, since: 1) all other forces have force-carrying particles, and 2) they would be extremely low-energy, since gravity is so weak, thus difficult to detect.  Also, although gravitons being affected by gravity might sound funny at first, it's really not so strange given that gluons are affected by strong nuclear force and have color.

Physics,"I’m not asking “what is energy” because there are countless literal definitions of it — but rather, what do YOU think energy is? How do you picture it? How would you describe it? When teaching, I’ve always found it so hard to explain it accurately to people without resorting to colourless textbook definitions, and today I found this extract while revisiting Introduction to Thermal Physics by Daniel Schroeder (awesome book for undergrads) in section 1.4:

“To further clarify matters, I really should give you a precise definition of energy. Unfortunately, I can’t do this. Energy is the most fundamental dynamical concert in all of physics, and for this reason, I can’t tell you what it is in terms of something more fundamental. I can, however, list the various *forms* of energy — kinetic, electrostatic, gravitational, chemical, nuclear — and add the statement that, while energy can often be converted from one form to another, the *total* amount of energy in the universe never changes. This is the famous law of **conservation of energy**. I sometimes picture energy as a perfectly indestructible (and unmakeable) fluid, which moves about from place to place but whose total amount never changes. (This image is convenient but *wrong* — there simply isn’t any such fluid.)”

I thought this was pretty neat, and it made me think about what the best way to picture energy is (and made me realise I don’t have a good picture of it in my head).

I have a question that I feel relates to physics and I’m not sure if I can get it answered with links to proof. So, this scenario is I am heading One Direction and another vehicle is heading the complete opposite direction. The opposing vehicle turns in front of me trying to beat me to the light and its rear end slides and ends up hitting the front of my car even though I tried to go around them. They were driving a Ford focus hatchback with two passengers and I was driving a Dodge Dakota with a passenger and an extra thousand worth of load in the backseat and the bed of my truck. I was going about 20 to 25 miles an hour due to rainy conditions. The argument they are holding is that because I slid, and the impact was on the rear of her vehicle, that means I must’ve been going over 35 miles an hour and as I spoke to them I explained that even at 20 to 25 miles an hour if you press your brakes hard enough and the road is slippery enough you can slide and they say that’s impossible, I must’ve been going faster than 35. I explained about rainy conditions on most blacktop roads and how it pulls up oil especially around the crosswalk areas where vehicles are stopped as they drip the most oil there. On top of that I gave him the comparison of the vehicle weights, average stopping distance is on dry roads versus wet roads and everything else like I was teaching a class. So I am looking for proof that at 25 miles an hour or even 20 miles an hour you can still slide on mostly level slippery roads for a certain amount of distance with over 5000 pounds or more worth of vehicle and payload.

Physics,"Not really sure if this is the right place to post this, but I had an idea today I wanted to share.

So we hear all the time about a 3D sphere moving through a 2D universe. To the inhabitants of the 2D plane, it would only appear as a circle getting larger and then smaller again before disappearing, as they have no way to conceptualize the third dimension.

Similarly, a 4D hypersphere moving through a 3D universe would appear as spheres of varying radii.

We have 3 spacial dimensions and 1 time dimension. And we would need that time dimension to perceive the transition of that higher dimensional object. But we also project our perception of a time dimension to that 2D universe, which would have 2 spacial dimensions and 1 time dimension. Why do we always have this oddball time dimension?

Our universe is a 3D slice of a 4D ""spacetime"". Similar to the hypersphere moving through the 3D universe, 4D spacetime ""moving"" through our observable universe would produce a similar perceived transition. Except instead of a confined sphere at some point in space, our entire observable universe would be transitioning.

So there is no ""time"" dimension, except conceptually to help us understand the world. Spacetime would be 4 spacial dimensions and 0 time dimensions. And one ""time"" dimension is conceptually required whenever an n+1-dimensional universe is interacting with a n-dimensional one (or observed from an n-dimensional viewpoint).",Thoughts on Higher Spacial Dimensions,1598373533

Physics,"Hi guys, this is my first time posting, so I hope I am not breaking any rules or being rude. I am a statistical physicist that works mainly with evolutionary game theory. Since the beginning of the year, I am working on merging epidemics models such as SIR and game theory. Recently me and collaborators finished our first manuscript on the subject, and it turned out really nice.  


In the model, there is a typical epidemic state where a general disease spreads from infected (I) individuals to susceptibles (S) by direct contact. After some time infected become removed/resistant (R). The novelty of the model consists of directly including evolutionary game dynamics that allow individuals to measure the global ""risk level"" of being infected and weight this risk with the costs of quarantining. Based on rational decisions, they can change the strategy state between a normal lifestyle (N) or impose a self-quarantine(Q).

&amp;#x200B;

With this simple addition, the SIR model starts to spontaneously present re-occurring infection waves, similar to what was seen in previous epidemics with voluntary quarantine (such as the Spanish flu, SARS, and obviously the current COVID-19 crise). What is more interesting is that while the total infection size is mainly governed by the usual epidemiological parameters (infection and recovery rate), the size of each infection wave (height of the peak) is mostly affected by the ""social"" parameters that come from game theory (that is, the average perceived risk of the disease).

Now, I really do not want to give the wrong message here. This is not an empirical model to predict COVID evolution. This is a very general framework that allows the merging of game theory and epidemiology through different venues than previous ""vaccination games"" (see the works from Bauch, Poletti, and Tanimoto for excellent examples) that use separate equations to deal with the epidemiological and the game theory aspects of the population. Nevertheless, with this addition, we get general features that have been observed in previous epidemic scenarios and allow for future refinement of the model, including more specific aspects of the real world.

I hope your guys find it interesting, the pre-print is already available at : [https://arxiv.org/abs/2008.05979](https://arxiv.org/abs/2008.05979)

Physics," Now, some textbooks have been telling me that when you do work against a conservative force, (""it is stored up as potential energy"") Apparently this gives the ability to do work, because when the force doing the work disappears, the conservative force acting on the object can do work on the object that converts this P.E. into K.E. Now, my question is that after the applied force has done work against the conservative force, and the source of the conservative force disappears, the potential energy stored up in the object really can do no work. So how can I harness this energy? It will be practically useless without the force field. So the conservative force shouldn't disappear, but what in the definition of conservative force prevents it from disappearing please explain fully. I feel like this has to do with the fact that unlike other forms of energy,P.E. isn't defined without its conservative force field. Please correct me if I'm wrong.

My problem is that given that I'm 20yrs old right now, I don't really truly want to spend 3yrs in getting a physics degree rather my thinking is to self study and audit as many classes as possible.

Physics,"Is it possible to explain the concept of Conjugate variables on toy examples? I will explain what I mean by ""toy examples""

https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Conjugate_variables

I believe I got pretty familiar with the ""Period and frequency"" example, there's a lot of good videos about it

But by ""toy examples"" I mean something that doesn't explicitly refer to specific math concepts or real life objects (but all wikipedia examples do both of that)

I also don't need examples based on everyday mechanisms, you can completely make up an nonexistent video game-like mechanism 

You can also give very imperfect examples and just add ""It's a very imperfect example. To make it perfect you should define this and that or add this...""

My ideas for possible (and possibly very imperfect) examples:

**Two clouds.** You have a blue cloud and a red cloud. The more you concentrate one cloud, the more spread the other cloud becomes. *Is it uncertainty relation between positions of two clouds?*

**Aquarium.** You have a fish in a glass box. The more transparent the box becomes, the more visible the fish becomes and vice-versa. *Is it uncertainty relation between visibility of two objects?*

**Multiplying giant.** There's an infinite-size giant. Its position is 100% unknown, but its identity is 100% known. The giant can shrink in size by creating other giants inside itself. The giant can shrink to a single point by creating infinity of other giants inside itself. So its position becomes 100% known, but its identity is 100% unknown. (a really convoluted and bizarre attempt to make an analogy of Fourier transform) ... *Is it uncertainty relation between position and identity?*

**The room and a lamp.** You have a small dimly lighted room. But when you try maximally light up the room it becomes infinite-sized. *Is it uncertainty relation between visibility and position?*

**Two (and more) boxes.** You have boxes with capsules of paint. You can ""ask"" a box to give you one of the capsules or mix all of the capsules. With the 1st box you 100% know the mixed color and have 0% probability to get any certain color in the single capsule. With the 2nd box you 100% know what color will be in the single capsule and have 0% probability to get any certain color after mixing. (you can add more boxes:) With the 1+1/2 box you have 50% probability to guess the color in the single capsule and 50% probability to guess the color of the mix. ... *Is it uncertainty relation between knowledge about color of the single capsule and color of the mix?*

(This is funny and you can go on with examples like this!)

What examples can you give if it's possible?

And if there's a more fitting math concept to those examples, what it is?

Additional question: what is the ""space""/function of conjugate variables' values? For ""Doppler and range"" uncertainty relation there's a two dimensional function known as [a radar ambiguity function (as far as I'm concerned)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ambiguity_function#Relationship_to_time%E2%80%93frequency_distributions)",Explaining Conjugate variables with toy artificial examples,1597819278

Physics,"In a double slit experiment, an electron gun is aimed along the X axis at the double slits in the shield and is emitting the electrons one at a time and at a reasonably slow speed. there is a nonzero probability of detecting the electron at points not on the X axis (i.e. with a Y deflection).  When an electron is detected at such an angle, the electron appears to have acquired momentum in the Y direction.  To conserve the momentum (in the Y direction), something else should get an equal and opposing momentum.  I do not think it could be a photon because those photons would be detectable, and I believe they never were. As the experiment is done in vacuum that leaves only the shield to carry that opposing momentum.  This leads me to the following questions regarding the timing of the shield experiencing this momentum, taking into consideration that it takes time for the electron to move between the shield and the detector.

If the shield experiences the momentum simultaneously with the electron detection, how is this momentum transferred to the shield across the distance separating the detector from the shield? 

Also, if the shield experiences the momentum if and only if the electron is detected implying that there will be no such effect if the electron is not detected. By arranging detectors on only one side of the screen and after many electrons, the shield would experience an accumulation of momentum in one direction and that would be measurable.  I do not think that is an acceptable alternative.
If the shield experiences the momentum exactly when the electron passes through the slits, then the momentum of the electron, and thus its trajectory, has already been established and there is no wave interference beyond the shield.
 
I am certain I am making a mistake, but I cannot figure out where.  My background is engineering and I am reading physics on my own. I appreciate any help in understanding and resolving this question.",Question regarding conservation of momentum in quantum mechanics,1597817811

My daughter is just about ready to tackle physics which I think she will really like. However today I got her to watch the start of a course on Great Courses Plus about classical physics and it was just terribly boring. The lecturer was really awkward and we didn't really learn much of anything.

She loves the 3Blue1Brown series of videos and has just started Grant's ""Essence of Calculus"". So I'm hoping to find something similar to that, but for Physics.

I also like to try and get her to understand the significance of people's contributions and what lead them to their discoveries (hence why I tried the Great Courses Plus lectures). So something with a bit of history would be great, but even if that was a different series altogether that would be fine.

She uses Khan Academy but she's finding it a bit dry (hence why we are starting Calculus with 3B1B).

Probably her favourite series ever was Welch Labs ""Imaginary Numbers are real"". If there was something out there as good as that for Physics I'd be over the moon.

She's fine with any math before calculus, so if it goes into that in any significant detail it's probably too advanced for her.

During one of the endsem exams this semester, I found myself wasting hours trying to write answers that involved circuits. Keeping track of wires, gates etc. was frustrating enough in LaTeX that I wondered why a tool like this does not exist. Hope this could be of some use to people.

I know it is basic coding and it is unoptimized at best.

    There exists a function of extensive parameters known as Entropy (S), using which all equilibrium states can be interpreted. An isolated complex system, lacking internal constraints, will have its extensive variables change to maximize the value of entropy over any such system which posseses an internal constraint.
    3rd axiom:
    A complex system's entropy is additive over its simple components. Entropy is a continuous differentiable function of internal energy that strictly increases.

All sorts of bizzare properties are exhibited by superfluid Helium, much of which are yet to be explained. 

Now, it is said that superfluid 3 Helium A has ferromagnetic properties. What if a device is designed, where the superfluid exists inside a toroidal (doughnut shaped) casing and it is spun to high speeds using electromagnetic fields. The electrical energy will be stored as rotational energy of the fluid; similar to Flywheel energy storage systems we have currently. The fluid will spin indefinitely as there is no friction.   Electric energy can be absorbed from the rotating fluid as well. 

The energy storage capacity is only limited by the strength of the toroid casing. Else, the device could work as a perfect reservoir of energy. Ofcourse, it won't be 100% efficient, coz of cooling apparatus and other leakage losses. But wouldn't it be much better than whatever we already have for grid scale energy storage?

Physics,"A question that arose recently on /r/AskPhysics was how to convert SI units to Planck units.  Instead of going through the usual motions of demonstrating with one narrow example, I would like to offer a more generalized treatment (posted here for future reference).  

The following is a procedure for (1) determining the Planck units associated with the SI base units, and (2) converting any other physical quantity expressed in SI directly in terms of Planck units.  This procedure can be easily coded up in the programming language of one's choice for convenience.  The basis for Planck units are commonly given as *[c,G,hbar,k_e,k](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Planck_units#Definition)*, and will be assumed here for the sake of presentation.  

(1) Each of the physical constants *c* (the speed of light), *G* (the constant of universal gravitation), *hbar* (the reduced Planck constant), *k_e*, (the Coulomb constant = 1/4piε0) and *k* (the Boltzmann constant) can be expressed as: 

    L^1 ⋅ M^0  ⋅ T^-1  ⋅ C^0  ⋅ Tmp^0   =  c
    L^3 ⋅ M^-1 ⋅ T^-2  ⋅ C^0  ⋅ Tmp^0   =  G
    L^2 ⋅ M^1  ⋅ T^-1  ⋅ C^0  ⋅ Tmp^0   =  hbar
    L^3 ⋅ M^1  ⋅ T^-4  ⋅ C^-2 ⋅ Tmp^0   =  k_e
    L^2 ⋅ M^1  ⋅ T^-2  ⋅ C^0  ⋅ Tmp^-1  =  k

where *L* is the Planck length, *M* is the Planck mass, *T* is the Planck time, *C* is the Planck current, and *Tmp* is the Planck temperature.  Reading across each equation, the exponents correspond to the SI dimensions of the associated physical quantity; for example, k_e = 8.988⋅10^(9) m^(3)⋅kg^(1)⋅s^(-4)⋅A^(-2)⋅K^(0).  Taking logarithms:

    1⋅log L +  0⋅log M + -1⋅log T  +  0⋅log C  +  0⋅log Tmp  =  log c
    3⋅log L + -1⋅log M + -2⋅log T  +  0⋅log C  +  0⋅log Tmp  =  log G
    2⋅log L +  1⋅log M + -1⋅log T  +  0⋅log C  +  0⋅log Tmp  =  log hbar
    3⋅log L +  1⋅log M + -4⋅log T  + -2⋅log C  +  0⋅log Tmp  =  log k_e
    2⋅log L +  1⋅log M + -2⋅log T  +  0⋅log C  + -1⋅log Tmp  =  log k

which is a system of five linear equations in five unknowns. The previous can be expressed in matrix form: 

    [ 1  0 -1  0  0 ] [ log L ]     [ log c  ]
    [ 3 -1 -2  0  0 ] [ log M ]     [ log G  ]
    [ 2  1 -1  0  0 ] [ log T ]  =  [log hbar]
    [ 3  1 -4 -2  0 ] [ log C ]     [log k_e ]
    [ 2  1 -2  0 -1 ] [log Tmp]     [ log k  ]

Multiplying both sides by the matrix-inverse of the left-most matrix: 

    [ log L ]     [ -3/2  1/2  1/2   0   0 ] [ log c  ]
    [ log M ]     [  1/2 -1/2  1/2   0   0 ] [ log G  ]
    [ log T ]  =  [ -5/2  1/2  1/2   0   0 ] [log hbar]
    [ log C ]     [   3  -1/2   0  -1/2  0 ] [log k_e ]
    [log Tmp]     [  5/2 -1/2  1/2   0  -1 ] [ log k  ]

which yields:

    log L   = -3/2⋅log c +  1/2⋅log G + 1/2⋅log hbar
    log M   =  1/2⋅log c + -1/2⋅log G + 1/2⋅log hbar
    log T   = -5/2⋅log c +  1/2⋅log G + 1/2⋅log hbar
    log C   =    3⋅log c + -1/2⋅log G                + -1/2⋅log k_e
    log Tmp =  5/2⋅log c + -1/2⋅log G + 1/2⋅log hbar                + -1⋅log k

Finally, exponentiating the above: 

    L   = c^(-3/2) ⋅ G^(1/2)  ⋅ hbar^(1/2)
    M   = c^(1/2)  ⋅ G^(-1/2) ⋅ hbar^(1/2)
    T   = c^(-5/2) ⋅ G^(1/2)  ⋅ hbar^(1/2)
    C   = c^(3)    ⋅ G^(-1/2) ⋅ k_e^(-1/2)
    Tmp = c^(5/2)  ⋅ G^(-1/2) ⋅ hbar^(1/2) ⋅ k^(-1)

(2) Any physical quantity *Q* given in SI units (disregarding those stupid quantities involving moles or candelas) can be directly converted to Planck units by way of the matrix product:

                  [ -3/2  1/2  1/2   0   0 ]
                  [  1/2 -1/2  1/2   0   0 ]
    [ a b c d e ] [ -5/2  1/2  1/2   0   0 ]  =  [ A B C D E ]
                  [   3  -1/2   0  -1/2  0 ]
                  [  5/2 -1/2  1/2   0  -1 ]

where *a,b,c,d,e* are the exponents of the SI dimensions m^(a)⋅kg^(b)⋅s^(c)⋅A^(d)⋅K^(e) of *Q*; and then expressing as:

    u⋅v^(-A)⋅w^(-B)⋅x^(-C)⋅y^(-D)⋅z^(-E)   c^(A)⋅G^(B)⋅hbar^(C)⋅k_e^(D)⋅k^(E)

where *u* is the numerical value of *Q* in SI and *v,w,x,y,z* are the numerical values of the five physical constants *c,G,hbar,k_e,k* when expressed in SI.  The numbers given in the 5-by-5 matrix result from solving the set of five linear equations in part (1); this matrix transforms the vector space of SI-dimensions exponents into the vector space of Planck-dimensions exponents.  

You may notice that the exponents A,B,C,D,E are negated within the numerical section; why is this?  A justification follows: Suppose you are tasked with converting 90,000 square feet to acres.  You already know that 1 acre is 43,560 square feet, so you need to *divide* by that numerical factor (equivalently, *multiply by the reciprocal*) in order to get the correct result:   

     90000 sqfeet = x acres

     (90000 sqfeet)/(1 acre) = x

     (90000 sqfeet)/(43560 sqfeet) = x

     90000/43560 = x

     x = 2.0661

Note that the five physical constants *c,G,hbar,k_e,k* serve as base units in the Planck Unit System, just as *m,ks,s,A,K* do in SI.  If one is more concerned about just the pure numbers themselves (like many physicists who routinely use Planck units in their work and arbitrarily set those five physical constants to 1), one can simply drop the string of physical-constant symbols at the end and call it ""u⋅v^(-A)⋅w^(-B)⋅x^(-C)⋅y^(-D)⋅z^(-E)"".  

A sample problem:  ""The food Calorie, which is 1 kilocalorie, is the heat energy required to raise the temperature of one kilogram of water by 1 degree celsius.  This has been measured and subsequently defined to be 4184 J.  Express this energy in terms of Planck units.""   

Since this problem involves mechanical units (LMT) only, it suffices to make use only of the top left 3-by-3 submatrix of the full transform matrix.  

The physical dimensions of energy are L^(2)⋅M⋅T^(-2), which corresponds to the vector [a,b,c] = [2,1,-2].  

               [ -3/2  1/2  1/2 ]
    [ 2 1 -2 ] [  1/2 -1/2  1/2 ]   =  [ 2.5 -0.5 0.5 ]
               [ -5/2  1/2  1/2 ]

The numerical value of the Planck expression is u⋅v^(-A)⋅w^(-B)⋅x^(-C) = 4184 ⋅ 299792458^(-2.5) ⋅ 6.6743e-11^(0.5) ⋅ 1.0545718176461565e-34^(-0.5) = 2.139e-6.  The associated Planck unit is the Planck energy, which is c^(A)⋅G^(B)⋅hbar^(C) = c^(2.5)⋅G^(-0.5)⋅hbar^(0.5).  Putting them together:  

    1 Calorie = 4184 J = 2.139e-6 c^(2.5)⋅G^(-0.5)⋅hbar^(0.5)

or just plain old 2.139e-6 where the underlying unit is understood to be the Planck energy.

Before trying to conceptualize this, place your arms down by your sides, and leave them loose, don’t be tense. Then, twirl your body rapidly like a figure skater....do they not seem to rise? Now imagine...if you kept them tense, and at an angle like an arrow symbol ( —&gt; )..would that not cause force either down toward your feet or upward in the direction your arms want to go?

Pipedream Idea: 

Say I have a machine that is solar powered, that causes a rod to spin, and on the end of that rod is the tip of an “arrow” shape (—&gt;) with high density metal balls at both ends of the arrow point (&gt;) (for leverage)...

The centrifugal force of the spinning rod, would cause a force in the direction of where the arrow is pointing (due to the metal balls on the arms of the arrow tip, causing the tip to “want” to become a straight line ( l ) rather than an arrow (&gt;)...so yeah...if there were two of them, oriented in the same direction, one spinning clockwise, the other counterclockwise, in unison, would that not propel a vessel either forward or backward?

The fuel source would be photons from the sun...and the equal and opposite reaction would be the eventual impact of the kinetic energy stored in the momentum of the ship, impacting elsewhere...right? No? Maybe?

The things I’m unsure of:

-if the rotation of the rod also creates a force in the opposite direction. 

-where the “rising arms” force would be directed. It’s either in the direction of the arrow, or in the opposite direction...right?

My thoughts are that if this were able to generate force, then momentum can be gained with time and ships can travel using only sunlight as fuel! But...I’m no physicist...so yea...probably some contradiction in the hairbrained idea.

Physics,"Considering that there is Planck time, the smallest measurement of time, then any time segment (i.e a second, a minute, etc.) Is a large summation of Planck time segments.

Then technically, any segment of time has a countable amount of Planck times. Although it would be a very large number, it's still possible. In this sense then, time acts more discrete, similar to the rational numbers (or irrationals).

Physics,"At first glance, this is superficially similar to the explosion in Tianjin port almost exactly five years, there appears to have been a major fire which detonated some explosive stored at the port. My background is in nuclear astrophysics, and I have a hobby interest in both nuclear explosions and high yield explosions in general (read: supernova and other transients). Digging up some notes and order of magnitude estimates I did following the Tianjin port explosion and using some rules I know from Glasstone and Dolan, we can make some estimates about the explosive yield in Beirut today. 

To begin, I will examine the [fireball growth](https://i.imgur.com/dgXE0Un.jpg) from this [video on twitter](https://twitter.com/arabnews/status/1290687176703967238). The fireball is only visible for a few frames, which I've assembled in that image.

Detailed analysis of the fireball is difficult, for obvious reasons, but there's still information to be extracted. For example, we can estimate a timescale from camera frame rates. The first frame is preceded by no visible fireball. A typical iPhone/smartphone camera captures at 30 frames per second, which is similar to Twitter's frame rate. 

For a length scale, we use the foreground objects as rulers. The foreground building nearest the explosion is, according to Google maps, the Beirut port silos. I measure its length to be between 100 and 150 meters. Given the angle of the building and the distance from the center of the fireball to the silos it's difficult to estimate the size of the explosion, but during the prompt expansion it does seem to exceed the dimensions of the silo, suggested a length scale of order 150 meters. 

While not precise, this does verify that there was a supersonic expansion phase into ~STP atmosphere, which allows us to generalize some of what we know about nuclear weapons. Furthermore, the size of the fireball as it enters its turbulent phase can be useful to estimate the maximum yield of the explosion. Typical scaling relations for surface detonations of nuclear weapons suggests a fireball radius of order (100 m)x(Yield/1 kilotonne TNT equivalent)^(0.3). This is the rough rule I keep in my head and not exact (I don't have the exact page in Glasstone and Dolan handy), but *taking the fireball radius to be of order 100 m to 200 m it suggests a yield in the 1-10 kiloton TNT equivalent regime.* I personally favor the low, 1ish kiloton regime given the superficial similarities to the events in 2015 in Tianjin (which was the explosion of 800 kilotons of ammonium nitrate). 

The most widely circulated videos seem to be taken from ~1-2 kilometers judging by foreground buildings, and is consistent with a shockwave arrival time of 3-6 seconds. Given the videos, it seems likely that the people operating those cameras experienced ~1ish PSI overpressure (and I hope they're okay!). This is a threshold I know for breaking glass, which may also be useful for estimating the yield. Regarding the impact of the shockwave, [CNN reports](https://www.cnn.com/2020/08/04/middleeast/beirut-explosion-port-intl/index.html): ""Homes as far as 10 kilometers away were damaged, according to witnesses. One Beirut resident who was several kilometers away from the site of the blast said her windows had been shattered by the explosion.""

While not explicit, we should wonder if windows were broken at 10 km. If we assume that the houses 10 km away did suffer broken windows as that would move the 1 psi overpressure radius to 10 km. As a rule, I also keep (1 km)(Y/1 kT TNT)^(0.3) in my pocket for the radius of 1 PSI overpressure. This would suggest a yield well beyond 10 kT TNT equivalent, indeed significantly greater than the Hiroshima or Nagasaki bombs, which seems significantly higher than the fireball analysis would suggest. I suspect that significant glass-breakage was experienced within 1-5 km.  

Seismic data and details regarding the explosion are also useful for also estimating yield, but are not available at this time. Furthermore, local atmospheric conditions and landscape/topography have a major effect on the impacts of high yield explosions, so it's difficult to improve on this estimate.  Again, these are order of magnitude estimates from scaling laws. They are quick and dirty- they're dirty precisely *because* they are quick.

Physics,"Hello all,

I studied physics in undergrad aspiring to become a physicist, but I couldn't handle the stress I put on myself to succeed on top of problems I had such as emotional immaturity and bad life habits, etc. I suffered depression, anxiety, and other mental disorders which took me long time to recover, even having tried many different kinds of jobs on the way, but I am convinced I want to go back and give it another try at my dream.

I'm not as sharp as I was, in fact although much better, I am still suffering from repercussions such as brain fog. But also I gained a lot from time spent in hiatus, such as learning to love and take care of myself, experiences in jobs unrelated to physics, etc.

I'm set to go back to university next spring, but its been frustrating because studying feels a lot more difficult because of how long it's been and the stuff I am going through.

I am wondering if there's other people who had similar experiences and would like to hear how you went through it, or advice for those starting late &amp; restarting studying physics. Btw my goal is to get a masters, and get a job in the quantum computing industry as a researcher/engineer.

Physics,"I'm a rising senior in high-school and taking AP Physics 1 this year really made me interested in pursuing physics. I've been trying to study AP Physics 2 over the summer and Coulomb's Law showed up in the electrostatics unit, what I realized was that it looked eerily similar to the equation that determines the force of gravity between two objects.

If gravity is a result of masses curving spacetime, does electric charge produce a similar effect? If so, why does that force the two charges to gravitate towards each other? Another question I have which I've been having trouble trying to answer is why does mass curve spacetime in the first place? It might be related to the mass-energy equivalence, which I'm reading about right now, but is there a simple intuitive explanation as to why this is the case? In my mind, I visualize space as a 3-dimensional vat where we are free to move and time as a linear expansion of that space. Why does the presence of mass warp that? I've seen the 3-d distortion models of what a presence of mass causes, but I'm just having trouble understanding why it causes a distortion in the first place/ why there is a ""fabric"" to the universe, and why it's not just fundamentally emptiness. If it has to do something with the massive amount of energy that was released as a product of the big bang, with lingering traces of that energy looming in space that'd make sense.

Physics,"I recently learned you can make plasma in a microwave with 2 grapes. My understanding of the science behind it (correct me if I’m wrong) is that microwaves use a frequency of 2.45ghz and a wavelength of 12cm. To the microwave the grapes might as well be water, and the refractive index for microwaves in water is about 10(closer to 9 but let’s go with the round number.) so the microwaves inside the grape move about 10x slower and have a wavelength about a tenth of its length in the air. So inside the grape it has a wavelength of about 1.2 cm which is about the size of the grape. With electromagnetic radiation things get strange when an objects size is equivalent to the wavelength of the radiation. the microwaves get sort of trapped in the grape and because of this it heats from the inside and energy builds in the center. Now if you put two grapes next to each other or touching then there will be interactions between the electric fields of one grape and the other. When the grapes are touching then all the energy will gather at the point of contact between the grapes and then it will cause sparks. These sparks are created because the electric fields of the grapes are strong enough to ionize the air(and potassium and sodium atoms in the grape) and then that creates ions which receive energy from the microwaves which then becomes plasma. So after all that(it is highly likely I got multiple things wrong) my question has to do with black holes. Specifically a Kugelblitz. So, theoretically, if you had a field in space of electromagnetic radiation and microwaves with a wavelength of 12cm and then you put two grapes that continuously made contact(despite this being basically impossible in a vacuum without some sort of mucilage) would it create plasma, and then would the plasma continuously gain heat and energy from the radiation until it got so hot and the wavelengths got so short that eventually it would be a perpetually expanding ball of plasma and gamma radiation similar to our sun? Would it be possible for the concentration of radiation on what was once the grape to become so intense that it’s energy formed an event horizon and became self trapped? If it were to become a star, rather than a concentrated point of radiation resulting in a kugelblitz, would it eventually collapse in on itself and possibly form a stellar black hole? I havent taken any physics classes (not even in highschool) so I apologize if everything I am asking about is completely wrong.

Physics,"Taken from this article: https://www.space.com/quantum-gravity.html



""Theorists discovered in the late 1990s that descriptions of a simple, box-like universe including gravity were mathematically equivalent to a picture of a flat universe with only quantum physics (and no gravity). The ability to jump back and forth between the descriptions suggests that space may not be a fundamental ingredient of the cosmos but rather a side effect that emerges from particle interactions.


As hard as it might be for us mortals embedded in the fabric of space to imagine, the relationship between space and particles might be something like the one between room temperature and air molecules. Physicists once thought of heat as a fluid that flowed from a warm room to a cool room, but the discovery of molecules revealed that what we sense as temperature ""emerges"" from the average speed of air molecules. Space (and equivalently, gravity) may similarly represent our large-scale experience of some small-scale phenomenon. ""Within string theory, there are pretty good indications at this point that space is actually emergent,"" Engelhardt said.""

Alright, so I know the very basics of perpetual motion and how it is [practically] impossible. I know the three laws of thermodynamics. I know the history of it. So these are my main questions:

Physics,"Yes, I know that movies are inaccurate and that you can't travel faster than the speed of light, but I believe that answering this question will further my understanding of the subject. Just please keep the answers reasonably accessible, think general public level.

So as far as I understand, the closer you travel to the speed of light, the greater the effect of time dilation is on you (the slower your clock is relative to a ""stationary object""). (Miniquestion: shouldn't that object be relative to you travelling near the speed of light and having more time dilation?). Now in movies, they say that when you hypothetically travel beyond the speed of light, you end up travelling to the past, as in arriving before you left, but that makes no sense to me. If near the speed of light it is YOUR clock that is slowing down, then wouldn't travelling faster make YOUR clock move backwards, as in you arrive after you left but you are like a year younger or something.

I know that there are many paradoxes here, like according to what I said, if you press a button to go faster than the speed of light, then the clock of your vehicle moves backwards and as a result the button is ""unpressed"" or even if that doesn't happen, what ever feul you use will have ejected from your space ship, how would the reaction in the engine go backwards if part of the feul is no longer on the ship, and so on.

With COVID-19 disrupting classes around the country, the Berkeley Society of Physics Students has decided to host virtual 'office hours' style review for students who want extra support with their learning. We especially have AP students in mind, since AP testing will be very unusual this year and we want to provide all the help we can give. These review sessions will be completely free, and open to various schools across the country via ZOOM (no account needed). 

These sessions will consist of a 90-minute review of the material the students have questions on, as frequently as we have interest and availability for. In the absence of questions, we will provide some practice problems to work on as well as discuss some commonly confusing topics.

The next one will be **this Saturday 1-2:30 PST**. If you are a teacher who thinks that your AP students will benefit from the review session, please forward this to your students, and tell them to email [charlie.cummings@berkeley.edu](mailto:charlie.cummings@berkeley.edu) with ""\[SPS Online Review\]"" in the subject line in order to RSVP, along with:

Couldn't it just be that without being measured, that a photon, being in superposition goes through both slits?

By that ^, I mean: Couldn't the photon exists in two separate realities (two realities where it goes through both slit 1 and slit 2, thus creating the interference pattern). 

What if The photon goes through both slits at the same time, because without measurement it exists in two potential realities (a reality for each slit) at the same time?

Could the interference pattern be the result of two realities existing at once when the experiment was conducted?

Also could the measurement tools/devices used in the experiment cause the collapse of the wave pattern, and cause the photons to act as waves because the measurement tools themselves exist in one specific reality? 

By this I mean, because the measurement devices exist in one reality, then wouldn't that mean they can only measure the photon in one specific reality? And if the photon is being measured by a tool that exists in one specific reality, then couldn't it be that the photon also only can exist in 1 specific reality as it cannot be in both just 1 reality, and also 2 realities at the same time, because idk, maybe it would violate some law of Quantum Physics for this to not be the case?",Double Slit Experiment Questions and Thoughts,1588178267

As is known from the Onsager rule, the SdH oscillation frequency is proportional to the extrema of the cross-sectional area of the Fermi surface perpendicular to the direction of the external magnetic field.  Now, suppose i have a material, with an open(or at least partially open) Fermi surface(for instance, like Copper has).

For the sake of simplicity lets assume the Fermi surface is a cylinder pointed along the k\_z direction. In an SdH setup where the angle between the field and the z axis(in kspace) of the sample is controlled, as the magnetic field vector approaches the x-y plane the cross-sectional area grows as 1/cos(theta), where theta being the angle between the magnetic field and k\_z. In a certain angle, the cross section of this Fermi surface no longer resides only in one Brillouin Zone, and it extends to adjacent BZs, that is to higher(and lower) k\_z values. The question is as follows - What happens, when the cross section extends beyond one BZ? Is the area relevant to the Onsager rule calculated in a single BZ? or is it considered to be the largest/smallest closed area in k-space? Or is it perhaps more tricky than that?

Physics,"So, I am a chemistry student who believes understanding the physics behind chemistry is vital. After hearing bad responses as to why entropy always increases I decided to try and make a little story in my head to explain it.  I just want to know if there is any truth to what I came up with:

So, if you have molecules or energy in some other form in a specific location and you give them more energy of any form, you create the potential to generate movement. The moment this happens, you increase the TOTAL number of configurations the system as a WHOLE can have. If this is the case, by letting time pass, we allow for those different configurations of the system to exist. Just like you allow a coin to flip heads or tails upon flipping it. But with system configuration, things are a little bit more exciting than with a coin. Because if you increase the volume of this system by just a little, you infinitely increase the number of configurations the system can have, and as we increase our observation window, it becomes infinitely many times more unlikely for a system to return to a position where energy is concentrated in a small volume. Not because nature is a magical entity that enjoys complexity, but because if motion isnt set off with infinitely precise (therefore infinitely unlikely) the ""AMOUNT"" of possible system configurations that result from time passing, simply overwhelms the possibility of the a more organized state. In the light of this argument, things like spontaneous life formation and the expansion of the universe make a LOT of sense, and in my case, with chemistry, a scenario that increases the entropy of the system is simply a scenario that is more likely to come into existence for every unit time due to the total amount of disorganized scenarios being greater than that of organized scenarios.

Physics,"The resting membrane voltage of excitable cells such as neurons and muscle cells is determined by the electrochemical equilibrium of potassium and sodium ions. This voltage is calculated by using the Goldman–Hodgkin–Katz equation. However, from the quantum perspective, ions with significant quantum tunneling through closed channels can interfere with the electrochemical equilibrium and affect the value of the membrane voltage. Hence, in this case the equilibrium becomes quantum electrochemical. Therefore, the model of quantum tunneling of ions is used in this study to modify the Goldman–Hodgkin–Katz equation in such a way to calculate the resting membrane voltage at the point of equilibrium. According to the present calculations, it is found that lithium—with its lower mass—shows a significant depolarizing shift in membrane voltage. In addition to this, when the free gating energy of the closed channels decreases, even sodium and potassium ions depolarize the resting membrane voltage via quantum tunneling. This study proposes the concept of quantum electrochemical equilibrium, at which the electrical potential gradient, the concentration gradient and the quantum gradient (due to quantum tunneling) are balanced. Additionally, this concept may be used to solve many issues and problems in which the quantum behavior becomes more influential.

Physics," Greetings Fellow Scientist,

As I was studying I came to a road block: ""How are histones basic and have a positive charge""? and ""Is the charge of the histone important for transcriptional gene regulation through histone modification""? I was perplexed and my world was slowly coming to an end (Not Really). However, I did some digging and I think I found the answer to my questions. Now I would like you guys to critique my answer, is it logical? What are the flaws? What are the strengths?  (Most of the physics is towards the end)

The Histone proteins H4, H2B, H2A, and H3 are basic and consist primarily of arginine, histidine and lysine ( the Basic Amino Acids). Theoretically, Lewis bases are generally negatively charged thus nucleophilic and Lewis acids are generally positively charged and thus electrophilic however basic amino acids and acidic amino acids are different from the typical acid and base.

Why are they different? Every amino acid has an acidic group, a basic group, and a R group thus one amino acid molecule can have multiple charges based on the environment. The pH environment plays a significant role on the charge of a particular amino acid. An acidic amino acids likes to be a zwitterion in acidic conditions, a neutral amino acid likes to be a zwitterion in a neutral pH conditions and a basic amino acid likes to be a zwitterion in basic conditions. This is where our knowledge of pkas and titrations come in. Acidic amino acids are negative in neutral pH conditions and basic amino acids are positive in neutral pH conditions.

Below is the titration curve of arginine and as you can see, arginine has a positive charge in neutral pH conditions.

&amp;#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/692o8e7dxeu41.png?width=402&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=544b291378c26ace14803aa94852a8e517c5c55e

We found the answer! Even though histones are basic, the pH of the nucleus ranges from 6 to 8. Therefore, all of the basic amino acids will have a +1 charge in the nucleus ( At homeostasis) . Because histones are primarily composed of basic amino acids, the charge of the histone will be positive in the nucleus. This is important because DNA is negative and the positive charge of the histones create an attractive bond between the DNA and the histones thus making DNA coil around the histones.

The positive charge on the histones are imperative to the process of gene regulation by histone modification: Transferase enzymes in the nucleus manipulate the charges on the amino acids of the histone proteins by adding a functional group to the histones. For example, lets imagine that we are an arginine methyltransferase (PRMT) and we methylate (tag with -CH3) the positively charged nitrogen's on the arginine amino acids of the histones. This would decrease the positive charge on the histones thus increasing negative charge. If our methylation creates a negative charge on the histone then this would create a kinetic force repelling the new negatively charged histone and the negatively charged DNA molecule (Coulombs Law). This allows space for transcription factors to bind to the promoter region and start transcription. Congrats, we just activated gene expression of a gene via histone modification. Now we are a histone demethylase (HDM) and take the methyl groups off of the arginines of the histone protein or demethylate it. The histone will revert back to a positive charge, creating an attractive force between the histone and DNA, closing the space for transcription factors to bind to the promoter region. Congrats we have just repressed gene expression!

I must clarify. There are multiple types of transcriptional gene regulation. Adding a methyl group to a lysine vs adding a methyl group to an arginine on a histone could have different effects. This is irrelevant to this discussion but important to be aware of. In this discussion, we are focusing on specifically transcriptional gene regulation via histone modification via changing the charge of the histone. Whether it is a acyl group, a methyl group, exc. Adding or Removing a functional group will change the charge of the histone (either more positive or more negative) thus changing its affinity to DNA. This is explained by Coulombs Law.

\+F = Attractive force = R increases = Euchromatin

\-F= Repulsive force = R decreases = Heterochromatin

q1 = histone - can be negative or positive based on Histone modification

q2= DNA

r= distance between histone and DNA

Therefore, if you change the charge of a q1 then you changed the distance  r from q1 and q2. The difference in charge is positively correlated with the force of repulsion or attraction between q1 and q2. 

""Simplicity is the ultimate sophistication"". I shall explain this in shorter terms. Transcriptional Histone modification is a type of nuclear gene expression and involves enzymes adding and removing functional groups in order to change the net charge of the histone proteins.

If DNA is negative and Histone is positive = Heterochromatin = no gene transcription

I (from the US) graduated with my BSEE in December 2018, and have been working full-time in a largely untechnical engineering job (that I strongly dislike) for more than a year now. Over this past week, I have been accepted into two Erasmus Mundus masters programs in Europe, one geared towards microwave engineering/optics and the other dedicated to photonics. The latter had been my top choice for a while now, but nonetheless, it's slowly sunk in that while engineering majors are accepted by the program, the majority of students are physics majors.

Which worries me, because my technical coursework isn't remotely comparable. The highest math I've taken is vector calculus and linear algebra for engineers. I don't have prior optics or photonics experience from undergrad, nor have I taken quantum mechanics or statistical physics - all that should be apparent from the transcript I submitted. The closest I got to any of that was my junior-level semiconductors class which I didn't do particularly well in. What I *did* study in some detail was electromagnetics for engineers, along with RF engineering and antennas, but even that can't compare to the rigor of electrodynamics for physics majors.

Now, my intention is to quit my job (my circumstances allow for it) and review and self-study as much as I can upon committing to a program in the near future, as I've simply forgotten so much over this past year of working. I should have close to four months to do that, assuming no delay caused by COVID-19. Still, I'm worried that even that won't be enough. One former student (physics) I reached out to said studying ""basic"" quantum mechanics in addition to reviewing E&amp;M was enough, and recommended ""Concepts of Modern Physics"" by Beiser for the former, which didn't look too bad. I was also planning to take a crack at the Griffiths QM textbook.

The course content for the 1st semester of the photonics program is on pg. 2-7 [here](https://www.europhotonics.org/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2017/10/Programme-Europhotonics_POESII-2017_2018-Marseille.pdf) - I don't know how detailed they will go into, say, Complex Analysis in the math review on pg. 4, and the personal projects on pg. 6-7 honestly are way over my head. Meanwhile, the microwave engineering/optics program is [here](http://www.erasmus-master.emimeo.eu/program-details/), and while I'm much more confident about self-studying for this one, I'm left wondering if I'd be chickening out due to fear by committing to this one over the photonics program. 

Any advice and resources would be greatly appreciated!","(x-post from r/AskPhysics) Accepted into an international photonics MSc with an electrical engineering BSc, suddenly second-guessing myself and feeling out of my depth",1587562374

This was ahead of me and hard to understand for me but I thought this sub would appreciate this list.

This list is a lesson from Stanford where he is a professor of theoretical physics and founding director of the Stanford Institute for Theoretical Physics. I found these links on Jooseph which is basically a collection for learning resources.

I am writing a screenplay about time travelers who are travelling from the year 2050 to kill their dictator in the year 2019 when she was a college student. No, there is no cyborg or Terminators involved. The time machine causes severe memory loss and most of the script is them trying to remember their identities and objective. The time travelers work at NASA and are building their time machine there under false pretenses. 

Anyway, right as one of the time travelers are being sent back, they are figured out and FBI agents are sent to capture them. The dictatorship doesn’t want any information of the time machine to leak, so as they make the arrests, they close off the building being used for the experiments under the pretense of some potentially dangerous accident happening (maybe a gas leak or something?)
 
What would be a good scientific reason for the FBI to give for the area to need to be cleared? Also, I realize that it would probably be another government body as opposed to the FBI who would deal with such a fake threat. But by my sci-fi movie logic, the FBI would be needed to capture the scientists and interrogate them and they would probably pretend to be with another government agency. (Remember the US is now a dictatorship, they can do pretty much whatever) in order to make their gas leak story more credible to the public. What would the appropriate government agency be?

How original was Noether's ""Invariante Variationsprobleme""? how modern were her use of Lie groups and her introduction of generalized vector fields? and how influential was her article? I shall sketch the curious transmission of her results from 1918 to 1970, the history of the later developments of her theory in mathematics and in physics, and the ultimate recognition of the wide applicability of ""the Noether theorems"".

I recently discovered my fascination with physics by listening/watching various podcasts and videos of famous physicists talk about their field. Two of my favorite physicists to listen to are Brian Cox and Sean Caroll. While their deeper and more advanced topics are what originally peaked my interest in learning more about physics, I would like to go all the way back to the very basics so I can better understand the theories and apply formulas to specific questions.

One of the things that fascinated me the most about physics, is how much it pertains to other fields of science since it is quite literally all about figuring out more about the universe we inhabit. Because of that, most of the physicists I've listened to are decently well versed in other areas of science, which is something I admire a lot.

I never had a very strong background in science or mathematics, so something that would be willing to ease me into it would be preferred.

I personally find it to be an interesting approach. He gave the following example on the Joe Rogan Podcast:

We can observe that the Universe has a ""preference"" in terms of left and right spin. There are numerous examples of this in different fields of od research. It pops up in the Higgs with electrons. Also when radioactive elements decay.

We struggle to understand this asymmetry as it really makes little sense. Weinstein gave the example of looking at your left hand. It looks asymmetric like the Universe we observe. But if you look at both of your hands they are symmetric. And as we know that nature tends to be symmetric, Weinstein proposes that there are other parts of the Universe where this symmetry is completed in relation to ""our"" part of the Universe.

In these ""other"" parts the electron with the opposite spin would have this property in the Higgs field and so on.

Physics,"Hey everyone, gr11 Canadian student here, long story short but basically I've been spending the extra time on my hands thinking about post-secondary (haven't thought about this until now). So after lots of browsing around on reddit, uni program descriptions, course lists, etc. I think I've brought it down to engineering, physics, and math and I was wondering what your opinions were between these 3 (fyi, double major isn't an option at the universities here that I want to go too).

Just some background that may be helpful: since like forever I've always been fascinated by machines - I used to draw planes in elementary school and since middle school I've been making random electronic things (like a little solar-powered desk bladeless fan). Based on this, I feel like engineering may be the right choice because of its hands-on nature, but at the same time math is hands down my first ""true"" passion, as cheesy as it sounds. As a kid I was really introverted (still am) so one day decided to check out Khan Academy and I got addicted to it lol. Been doing math ever since (contests, uni lecture notes, etc). A part of me loves the idea of just sitting down for hours at a time working through things like curl or series. BUT, when I was introduced to physics in gr9 (circuits) I was again just... mesmerized. Just the idea of electrons in a wire or why gravity's equation is the way it is, etc.

Now, this is getting long, but here's some unrelated info: even though I'm extremely introverted as a ""person"", that's not the case with group projects etc. Another thing regarding math - I need the proof or at least intuition of formulas (ex. if you plop cosine law in front of me for the first time I just ""must"" try to find a proof/search it up if I can't), but at the same time I'm not sure if very abstract stuff is my thing (like sets). Finally, I know people say follow your passion but truth is, I want to make a decent amount of money mostly just to give back to my parents and because of their struggles - they were first generation immigrants (btw they don't care what I do as long as I have a stable job in the end).

Physics,"I had a strange experience last fall and I just wondered if I may describe it to you and see if you have any ideas. 

What jogged my memory was this fact that was shared to me.

""Portland, Maine's latitude is approximately 43 degrees north and so the celestial equator passes 90 - 43 = 47 degrees above due south.""  


I remember I had been curious where exactly the sun may have sat in the sky, relative to my position in Portland, Maine between 2 and 3 PM on October 4th, 2019.  


The reason being I had this strange little experience at that time!

I was lying on a bench, and placing my cell phone above my face so that it blotted out the sun. When I positioned the cell phone horizontally (about 5 inches long by 2 inches wide) to my face, and moved it closer to my face, naturally the phone got bigger and blotted out a little more and more of my vision. When rested against my nose, the horizontal phone is long enough to partially cover both my eyes and appear as a solid gray slab in the middle of my vision, with a ring around it where I see past. (If I remember right, the phone was horizontal, if it had actually been vertical, then it would have run up my face, basically covering my nose and perhaps a little bit of each eye, so that my eyes see past the phone but there is a sort of 'ghost' image of the phone.'

What I noticed was when I blotted out the sun with my phone at arms length, it appeared as if bright light, the suns rays, were shining from the outskirts of the phone. As I brought the phone closer to my face, the rays of light extended closer to the center of the phone. But what happened next really surprised me, and I tried for some time without success to replicate. By the time the phone was resting against my nose, it still appeared that rays of light were emitting out of the middle of the phone, but at the exact center, there appeared a black circle. The black circle appeared a similar size as the sun itself, and reminded me very much of the solar eclipse that I saw a few years back. It was just very odd, and odd that I hadn't been able to replicate. I realize there is probably a lot going on that I do not understand with light, and with the way my eyes work, but I just found it very interesting. 

&amp;#x200B;

It appeared as if I fabricated a solar eclipse by blotting out the sun with my phone. Any thoughts?

Physics,"Why do sound waves emminating from the front of an object moving forward become compressed for the observer also standing at some point in front of the object?

I mean, I get that this is responsible for the Doppler effect, etc, but why do the waves actually *compress*? Is it because the observer sort of hears a layered effect of simultaneously hearing a more outer-ring sound wave that the object gave out when it was farther away, on top of more inner-ring sound waves as the object moved closer?

If that was the case, wouldn’t that indicate that as a sound wave moves out from an object (moves from being a more “inner ring” sound wave to being a more “outer ring” sound wave), the pitch drops? Ie. Taking two unmoving observers and an unmoving sound source, the further away observer would hear the sound as a lower pitch. But that’s not the case, from what I understand. For still sources and observers, only the volume will drop if the observer is further away, not the pitch. So I don’t see how “layering” sound waves of identical pitch could be responsible for the compression.

So how do sound waves ACTUALLY become compressed, or is it just something we know that they do?

I hope my question makes sense! :-)",Why are sound waves from moving objects compressed?,1586270710

Now what Penrose says is that Schrödinger never meant for the experiment to be scientific proof of parallel universe, but instead what he really said is that quantum mechanics is **wrong** .

He basically said ""look guys this theory is so nuts it would mean that my cat is both alive and dead at the same time, we are clearly missing something here"".

Physics,"I have been doing a bit of research about the [moment captured on video](https://vimeo.com/2109735#t=159s) during the Apollo 15 moon landing when the astronaut David Scott bounced past a flag and the flag started to move. The cause of the movement is debated. A semi-official explanation on [Nasa's Apollo 15 lunar surface journal](https://www.hq.nasa.gov/office/pao/History/alsj/a15/a15.clsout2.html) is that Scott touched the flag with his elbow (see the entry at 148:57:15). The journal says that the idea he was carrying a static charge which caused the flag to move is ""very unlikely"" since there were no similar flag movements seen in other moon walks. However, I think Scott was too far from the flag to have touched it, as shown in [this video of a 3d recreation of the scene](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rsYcOiyuVC4). According to that, Scott was about a metre from the flag. So I think the movement must have been caused by static electricity.

According to this [slideshow by a NASA scientist](https://ntrs.nasa.gov/archive/nasa/casi.ntrs.nasa.gov/20160013625.pdf) (slides 7 and 8), static charges dissipate on the moon in microseconds, which would make it hard to see how Scott could have been carrying a charge when he passed the flag. The reason for the fast dissipation is the solar wind, which bombards the moon with electrons and protons and creates a ""plasma sheath"" of electrons around the moon. These ambient electrons act as a ground to any positive charge and dissipate it. Interestingly, though, a negative charge takes slightly longer to dissipate, because it is dissipated by the ions in the solar wind, which are less dense than the electrons in the moon's plasma sheath. I found an interesting paper, ""[Concerning the dissipation of electrically charged objects in the shadowed lunar polar regions](https://agupubs.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/full/10.1029/2008GL034785)"", which gives a formula for the amount of time it takes for a static charge to dissipate on the moon. As an example they provide calculations for a position 85 degrees from the subsolar point (the point directly under the sun) -- near the ""terminator"" region (the terminator is the line between the day and nightsides of the moon). But I think the maths actually works anywhere on the dayside surface, for negative charges at least, since the density of incoming ions from the solar wind is the same everywhere on the dayside, at 5 per cubic centimetre.

The most interesting fact is that the time taken for the charge to dissipate is inversely proportional to the area that the charge covers. This is because the larger the area, the more ions will come into contact with the charged surface, and the quicker the charge will be dissipated. So if the charge is concentrated in a small area, it takes longer to dissipate. The example given in the paper is of an astronaut's spacesuit, with an area of 10 square metres. They say a negative charge would dissipate from a spacesuit in 0.003 seconds. But for an astronaut's boot, which is only 1m², the charge would take ten times longer (0.03 seconds) to dissipate. Using the formula given I calculated that a negative charge that covered only 80cm² would take 3.5 seconds to dissipate, which would have given Scott time to receive the charge off-camera and to move past the flag while still charged, making the flag move.

Using the [Quickfield](https://quickfield.com/free_soft.htm) electric field simulation software I set up a [3D scene](https://i.imgur.com/eOom8fl.png) where an astronaut is one metre from a flag, and set an 80cm² area on the astronaut's arm to be charged to -10,000 volts. [The result showed](https://i.imgur.com/KHDqZOk.png) that the presence of the charge on the astronaut produced a force of 0.000002 Newtons on a selected 9.3cm² area in the corner of the flag. I have not studied physics but using the procedure outlined [here](https://www.khanacademy.org/science/ap-physics-1/ap-linear-momentum/introduction-to-linear-momentum-and-impulse-ap/v/force-vs-time-graphs) I tried to calculate the effect this force would have on the flag. Assume that the force was applied for 1 second, which is about the amount of time it took the astronaut to pass. 0.000002 Newtons for one second is an impulse of 0.000002 Newton-seconds. Since impulse/mass = final velocity - initial velocity, and since the initial velocity is zero, it's just necessary (I think) to divide this impulse by the mass of the small flag section to find the velocity in meters per second that the flag section would end up with.

[This flag](https://www.usflagstore.com/US_Flag_3x5_Embroidered_Nylon_p/60-100-3111.htm) is the same size as the one used on the moon (3' by 5') and according to the linked web page it weighs .55 lbs, which is 249 grams. In the moon's gravity 249 grams would be 41.17 grams. 9.3cm² is 0.00067 times smaller than the full flag, so reduce the weight by the same factor to find the weight of the piece of flag we are looking at. This works out as 0.028 grams, or 0.000028 kilograms. 0.000002Ns / 0.000028kg = 0.07 metres per second, or 7cm per second. So according to this, the 9.3cm² area of flag would have been moving at 7cm per second after the astronaut passed. This speed seems reasonable, however, I assume that the calculation is not totally accurate, since it would seem to give the velocity if the force was applied upwards, against the moon's gravity, rather than sideways. I don't know enough to take the direction of the force into account. Presumably it would take less force to move the flag sideways than to move it upwards, so the charge on the astronaut would not need to be as large as -10,000 volts to cause the movement seen. It would be great if anyone knows how much force would be needed to move the flag sideways.

As to how the astronaut received the charge, I assume he touched some object offscreen, perhaps a piece of metal equipment. The spacesuits were coated in Teflon, which is [very electronegative](https://www.alphalabinc.com/triboelectric-series/).",Static electricity on the moon and why the Apollo 15 flag moved when the astronaut didn't touch it,1585141408

Physics,"Ey, I have a background in chemical engineering and have been working in DataAnalysis-SW-IT most of my adult life so my knowledge of physics can't be considered deep by any means but I wanted to, nevertheless, pose a question.

I think I understand that there is no an absolute time that ticks the same for all of us and that there is this thing called ""proper time"" or ""inner time"" (or something like that) which is what an observer would experience in his own frame of reference. This rate of passage of time depends on things like the velocity the observer is travelling with or gravitational fields affecting him.

I've read a bit on it in places like  [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Experimental\_testing\_of\_time\_dilation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Experimental_testing_of_time_dilation) where one can see how moving muons have longer lifetimes than resting ones...

Now comes the question from me...

Is the ""proper time"" of two quantum entangled particles necessarily the same? Can their clocks tick at different rates?

If it would be necessarily the same, would this imply that the state being entangled is something that we can declare to be independent of things like velocity, gravity, etc?

Perhaps a pair of particles would be entangled if and only if their internal clocks are exactly the same one. The moment something ""perturbs"" the common clock, entanglement vanishes...

Perhaps the most important question... does the question itself make at least a bit of sense?

Physics,"I am an astrophysicist at Cambridge University who was recently sent to my home country due to the Corona crisis. In my boredom I have derived a simple approximation to help you estimate the number of people that are currently infected with the Corona virus. The derivation is based on the number of people that die, as that is the only parameter that is accurately tracked with the current testing shortage.

Assumptions/parameters:
The virus doubles every *td* days. A fraction *x* of infected people dies after *tx* days, while (1-*x*) heal after *th* days. Then we can derive for the number of newly infected people that:

Newly infected people (*I*) per day based on the number of deaths that day (*D*):
*I* = *D/x* \* 2^(*tx/td*)

Total number of infected people (*N*) per day based on the number of deaths that day (*D*):
*N* = D td / (ln(2)*x*) \* 2^(*tx/td*) \* (1-2^(*th/td*))

If we plug in the numbers that are currently floating around (*x~0.01, td~6, th=tx~20*), the formulae approximate to:
*I~1000 D*, 
*N~10000 D*
But feel free to adopt parameters that you feel are more accurate to the specific region you are looking at. As an example, this approximates about 150.000 new Iranian cases today (from 150 deaths), with an infected population at 1.5 million.

While this may not be a pure physics question I do feel that it would be interesting to learn what answers people who have dedicated their lives to the field think. Also with regards to the guidelines before reporting this post for not being based in science. This post is attempting to explore the validity of math and physics.

First some context:

An example of math being discovered and later applied to physics only for it to be a perfect representation.

The Greeks discovered parables by cutting cones in specific ways. Later parables could be graphed. Parables turned out to perfectly represent the path that a projectile follows with regard to gravity. 

Possible example of math not fully lining up as a perfect representation of physics. 

Banach–Tarski paradox, curves having infinite point, y=1/x.

Math with regards to physics:

1) an underlying truth that governs our universe and reality meaning that anything, in reality, can be represented by our mathematical system.

2) a way of thinking that is used to describe and understand our universe but not necessarily a truth. (be kind to me about this one pleas I just learned about fictionalism)

3) a logic prosses that where all things that happen can be explained with but not all mathematical ideas necessarily have to be applicable to existence.

4) If you agree with none of the answers I would love to hear what you think math is with regards to physics.

Physics," So I’m writing a physics paper on how ballistic pendulums react with a change with regards to a change in the projectiles mass keeping everything else constant (yes even the velocity of the projectile). I am analyzing my data with the weight of the projectile on the x axes and the PE of the ballistic pendulum at T/4 (T is period). I know its kina a stupid topic but its all I could come up with. Also I should mention that I am treating this as a SHM problem ie very little calculus. I also wrote a simulation on demos of a SHM that you can change the velocity on. 

Here it is ([https://www.desmos.com/calculator/28ymp0npde](https://www.desmos.com/calculator/28ymp0npde)).

Any way it was all good until I decided to look at the KE of the projectile BEFOR it collided with the ballistic pendulum using the equation KE=.5M1(V)\^2+.5m(v)\^2 (where V is projectile velocity and v is pendulum: v=0 so KE=.5M1(V)\^2). The equation for PE after the collation is 

M= mass of the projectile

m= mass of the pendulum 

PE After collition=PE1=((MV)\^2)/(2(M+m)).

The problem that I am having is that the law of conservation of energy says that the KE0=PE1. If you plug in numbers to both equations this is not true. I cant figure out why. PLZ help!!

Physics,"[BRST symmetry](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/BRST_quantization) is discussed in pretty much every introductory QFT class when quantizing gauge theories. It's a global symmetry of gauge theories that involves ghost fields. The conserved, nilpotent BRST charge allows us, via its cohomology, to pick out physically distinct states while modding out the redundant gauge degrees of freedom.

I have several questions about BRST symmetry. To summarize, my issue is that I understand BRST symmetry and cohomology on a superficial level, but I don't understand:

* **How could we have guessed that BRST symmetry exists without knowing about it in advance?**  
* **How do we know there aren't other global symmetries in gauge theories that we don't know about?**  
* **What is the deeper, geometrical meaning of BRST symmetry?**

The textbooks I've consulted so far (Peskin and Schroeder, Schwartz, and Srednicki) seems to pull this symmetry out of thin air. Of course, given the form of the BRST transformation, anyone can check it is a symmetry of the gauge-fixed Lagrangian. But if you just handed me the Lagrangian, how could I have guessed or known that such a symmetry exists, whose cohomology has the desired properties? Where does it come from? And what if there's another global symmetry lurking in there that we're just too dumb to see--is there a way to know that there are no other conserved charges?

I have also heard that BRST symmetry can be understood in a geometrical or topological sense, and it would be nice to learn this perspective.

Any resource recommendations on the topic are appreciated too. I started reading *Quantization of Gauge Theories* by Henneaux and Teitelboim, but it's not easy reading by any means--very abstract and technical. Something a little more concrete would be great.

So for this discussion let's assume that the heat death model for the future of our universe holds true and let's also assume that cosmic inflation keeps accelerating like we have observed.

So we know that the universe is pretty young right now. Many stars have lifespans in the trillions of years and we are only not even 14 billion years old. Yet we still already see black holes like TON 618 which are billions of solar masses and many times the size of our entire solar system.

So by the time we get to the point in heat death where the only thing on the universe is black holes, I'm sure they will be unbelievably massive after trillions of years of absorbing stuff and mergers. (As an aside what would it be like if two TON 618 size black holes merged? The gravitational waves generated must be ungodly to imagine...).

Since the rate of expansion Is also accelerating, what we will have is massive mega black holes maybe even as big as a fraction of a light year in size, and the universe will be ripping it apart from the inside.

So now for my questions.

Does the rate of expansion of the universe also hold true for the space inside of the event horizon of a black hole? In other words, is the space inside of an event horizon subject to inflation

Could the size of the black hole be increased (even slightly) due to inflation pulling it apart faster than its losing mass due to hawking radiation?

The time is takes for these size black holes to evaporate is 10ungodly amount of years. Could it reach a point where inflation pulls it apart faster than it looses mass? Especially if the rate of expansion continues to accelerate?

Is it even possible to pull apart a black hole like that? If so, what would it look like as that happened and what effect would it have on the mass/size. If not, what effects if any does inflation have on massive black holes during the quadrillions of years that the black hole slowly evaporates.

I need you to imagine you have two identical tanks of water, filled with an identical amount of the same liquid. Well call them Tank A and Tank B.

However Tank A has a perfectly straight pipe, Tank B has a pipe with a bulge somewhere along the lines, looks like a small party balloon.

My questions I have to you clever people. Would the flow rate through the pipe of Tank B be quicker than that of Tank A.

If not, if I added identical pumps into these tanks, would the pump in Tank B use less energy to pump the water out than Tank A. Or would the pump in Tank B be able to pump the water out at a greater velocity using the same amount of energy as in Tank A.

Physics,"So there is nothing total vacuum, but if there was nothing at all then you would not be able to travel through the emptiness of space, there has to be something there for nothingness to exist in.

My semi working theory is complicated so here is a scenario to explain it, you cant have nothingness, something has to be in the space where there appears to be nothing. On a 2 dimensional level, take a desk, if we are a 2 dimensional entity stood on my desk, I can only see things on the desk, but where there is nothing on the desk I cant see it, so I name this empty space. But the desk exists in the 3rd dimension and so we know that the desk occupies that space not nothingness. But if you take the desk away from the 3D space there is no universe for the 2 dimensional desk entity to stand on, so they cease to exist, and all of the objects that they can see and interact with disapear too, the whole 2D desk universe ceases to exist.

That was messy but it gets clearer, we know that there is a 3 dimensional world where that desk can exist, in this 3 dimensional universe, planets, stars, the earth, and us all exist now. But in empty space there is no physical material occupying the emptiness, but I can place too objects in empty space say a book and a pen, and I can observe them as they exist within our dimension, but for them to be there, there has to be a 4th dimensional plain on which the book and pen sit, or float.

Like a 2 dimensional universe is a flat plain, and a 3 dimensional universe is a fluid that 3 dimensional objects and entities can float, or in the case of earth, stand upon another 3 dimensional object as they are attracted to it due to gravity.

So this super confusing 4th dimensional universe has to have a kind of fluid material in it for 3 dimensional objects to exist within, and this 4th dimensional liquid is referred to as the ""Fabric of the Universe"" but really is it a giant concoction of dimensional matter that could possibly be where Anti matter, and Dark matter exist, and other more undetectable substances. If so and it sounds like it's right, then what the fuck must the universe look like if your a 4th dimensional being, and what is in the 5th dimension?

So nothingness can only exist in the dimension bellow the dimension that the thing nothingness is in.

So for there to be nothingness in 3D universe, like in empty space, there has to be a fourth dimensional universe, for the 3rd dimensional nothingness to exist within.

This is question about law of conservation of mass [\[1\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Conservation_of_mass) as defined by [Mikhail Lomonosov](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mikhail_Lomonosov) and rediscovered by [Antoine Lavoisier](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Antoine_Lavoisier) in 18th century based on information gathered from reference number 1 where it is stated as follows:  


&gt;The **law of conservation of mass** or **principle of mass conservation** states that for any [system closed](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Closed_system) to all transfers of [matter](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Matter) and [energy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Energy), the [mass](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mass)  of the system must remain constant over time, as system's mass cannot  change, so quantity can neither be added nor be removed. Therefore, the  quantity of mass is conserved over time.

Where closed system is defined as: [\[2\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Closed_system)

&gt;A **closed system** is a [physical system](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Physical_system) that does not allow certain types of transfers (such as [transfer of mass](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mass_transfer)  in or out of the system), though the transfer of energy is allowed. The  specification of what types of transfers are excluded varies in the  closed systems of [physics](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Physics), [chemistry](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chemistry) or [engineering](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Engineering).

&amp;#x200B;

Assuming that provided sources are still valid definition in 20191218 (YYYYMMDD) then how does this apply to the carbon-based lifeforms assuming perfect closed system (to avoid any interference outside of used system) and assuming that said system has a one plant and everything it needs to survive (but assuming a system that is not self-sustainable) where plants seems to process nutrients (H2O, O2, N, etc..) and photons (light) into **what seems to be** a complicated molecule structure.  
So i would assume that nutrients are chemically converted into a said molecule structure (no lose of mass here as far as i know), but what is the role of photon assuming that photons are an elementary particle [\[4\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Photon) that i would assume binds to the molecule structure since if photons are removed said plant would slowly die off does this mean that plants are able to store photons?  
How can we proof that photon particles are not ""destroyed"" in this system?  
What is considered as energy in this scenario and how can we proof that the count of the particles in said closed system stays constant even after the plant dies off assuming that we did not created a self-sustainable environment that would process those particles in such a way that would satisfy the plant life or that said plant would naturally died?

Physics,"I had GR two years ago. We had a very theoretical approach by a professor. So a lot of differential geometry and everything was really mathematical. Unfortunately, we did not caculate any examples, so although the math of everything was very clear to me, I cannot really caculate ""stuff"". I do not like GR and mainly study Condensed Matter now, so I pretty much forgot all my advanced knowledge in Diff. Geometry. However, we are now doing Black Hole Information Theory in Quantum Info Theory and I want to ressolve my eternal struggle with GR once and for all.

The main source of my struggle are the Field Equations themselves. They relate the curvature of our manifold (spacetime) to the matter (energy momentum tensor). To my knowledge, both of these are vectorfields, so functions from the manifold M to TM (the manifold of the tangent bundle), so just some vector space. So, f.e. for the components of the energy momentum tensor T: T_uv(x), where x is element in M. Now, I can find local chart trans. maps such that I can map a neighbourhood around x to euklidian space. So, I have a function T_uv(x0,x1,x2,x3). BUT, how can I define myself a chart trans. map without knowing the curvature. From my understanding, the curvature is a vector field that defines on every point x on the manifold how it is curved, thus it describes the form of it near x. This quantity is determined by the Field Equations. So by T. But how can I caculate with T if I do not know how the manifold is ""formed""?

So gravity, according to relativity, is an effect of matter, and we see stronger gravitational fields in the universe than should be possible with matter as we see it. However, as we know, gravity bends spacetime, but it can also slow the expansion of spacetime according to the FLRW metric (as I understand it, I could totally be wrong please let me know if that's the case). 

Thus my question, could the reduced rate of spacetime expansion by gravity be holding galaxies and clusters together, and not dark matter?

Physics," This is something I posted earlier on r/SeriousConversation, but I figured that I would also post it here as well.

   Black holes have been a very mysterious and fairly popular topic to bring up in Astronomy and Astrophysics. The only celestial body in the universe that we haven't figured out. It is massive, usually with a typically found mass of 20 times that of our own sun. It's escape velocity greater than the speed of light itself. The single object which seems to shatter the law of physics, which we painstakingly drew out and created. From the years of studying them, we've learned relatively little about them. We know how they are created, how massive they can become, their extreme effect on light, and how they (usually) behave. However, one strange fact seems to stand out to me like a sore thumb. Almost everyone I talk to who is passionate in physics-related discussions says that their gravity is ""infinite"" due to their ""infinite"" density, and with good reason too! All textbooks say this, well as online articles, all of these people and sources basing their information on the ""idealized"" model of black holes that is universally accepted. However, the idea doesn't conceptually make any sense to me. Allow me to give you an example. Say that the universe was completely empty, save for two baseballs. These baseballs are one meter apart from each other. Due to **gravity,** **which is caused by mass**, the two balls will gradually drift towards each other, drawn together by the force of their mass acting upon each other. While the gravity is very weak, it will always be acting on the two balls, regardless of the distance. They could be *10 meters* or even ***10 parsecs*** away from each other, but due to this simple fact, while the force would be **astronomically small**, it would still be acting on the two balls, and they would eventually come together once more. The same applies to everyday life. Although you are so far away from the sun that you couldn't notice it, the sun is always applying a force on you, and vice versa(Newton's Third Law). Granted, **that force weakens inversely to the square of the distance.** But then, by that logic, if the gravity of a black hole was in fact ""infinite"", that would mean that the force would not decrease in magnitude over a distance(*since anything subtracted from infinity, even infinity itself, has been known to still result in infinity*), and so no matter how far away we are from a black hole, we would be under the influence of that ""infinite"" force, which, as a result, would mean that all of humanity, all the life in the universe, every last proton, neutron, electron or otherwise that exists will literally be ripped from their current location and be consumed by the ridiculously immense and all-powerful black hole that just formed from all of the black holes in the universe merging into one location, with all of the aforementioned events occurring at the same time, in a short a time as physics would allow, leading up to what can only be described as an event similar to the ""Big Crunch.......................................................................................................................................................

   Wait a minute....... **WE'RE ALL STILL ALIVE!!!!!** Surely the fact that none of this has occurred means that gravity isn't infinite, right? **An infinite value decreasing exponentially over a distance would still be infinite**, but a finite value definitely would!  Thinking along with this mindset, it also means that the force of this gravity has a limit, a limit which can be **Calculated.**

   I think this because when it comes to calculating gravity, *gravity is inversely proportionate to the square of the unit distance.* Since we know that regardless of location, **the escape velocity***(****Vi****)* at the edge of the event horizon for any object(mass or massless) **WILL**(correct me if needed) be equal to lightspeed, and adding that the distance of the edge of the event horizon(***where C is equal to gravity/Vi***) to the center(the singularity) would be the **radius(*****d*****)** of the Blackhole. Knowing these, you can now calculate the approximate **mass(*****m*****)** of the Blackhole by multiplying **(*****Vi******^(2)*** **by** ***d*****)**, then dividing that by the **Universal Gravitational Constant(*****G*****, or (*****6.67×10******^(-11)******×2*****)**. With this knowledge in hand, and knowing **mass(*****m*****)**, the **gravitational constant(*****G*****)**, and the distance of any point inside the event horizon from the center(***r***), you can say that ***Vi=c at d***, you can calculate the escape velocity at any point within the event horizon by getting **the square root of 2(*****Gm*****)/(*****r&gt;any distance between&gt;0*****)**. Granted, the number is going to be ***ASTRONOMICALLY LARGE,*** *but still finite.*

 BOOM, escape velocity inside of the Event Horizon calculated, and to my understanding, we can use that to find the force of gravity at any point inside of the Blackhole(aside from the Singularity, I believe). Personally, I don't know where to go from here to calculate it, but in my opinion, my argument is very valid, and with calculating escape velocity beyond the event horizon, I've taken my first step towards proving it!

# However, this is just what I think. Please share what you think about my ideas, and please correct me if I have added misconceptions or incorrect information! I look forward to your feedback!                              Thank You!

Physics,"  

Should the constancy of the speed of light in vacuum be understood to have the value c ""relative to the material detector"" and not necessarily c relative to the reference frame of description?

An experiment observing a distant celestial body could be performed to check that alternative interpretation to the Special Theory of Relativity.

\- First: Observe (and photograph) the distant body with a powerful telescope when the body is near the horizon of the observation site. It must be a body that can be seen either looking east or west (but not looking north or south).

Doing so, the body will be observed when the Earth has its maximum (or its minimum) annual speed relative to the body.

\- Second: Photograph again the body 6 months later and again when the body is near the horizon of the observation site.

 If in the first observation the detector (the Earth) was ""approaching"" the body it will now be ""receding"" from it (and vice versa).

Let v be the orbital speed of the Earth around the sun (v =30 Km/sec approximately). 

Let d be the average distance between the body and the Earth.

If it happened to be true that the speed of light in vacuum is c relative to the primary detector (in this case the Earth's atmosphere) and not necessarily c relative to the description frame (the sun) nor to the emitter (the body) then: 

\- The light received in the first observation will have travelled the distance d with a speed c-v (or alternately c+v) relative to the sun while in the second observation the observed light will have travelled the distance d with a speed c+v (or alternately c-v) relative to the sun. That difference of speeds imply that the first observation is receiving the light emitted from the body at an epoch t1 earlier than the epoch t2 in which it emitted the light received in the second observation. If the body is very far away the difference t2-t1 will be much bigger than the 6 months delay between the two observations (that should also be accounted for).

If the observed body was changing significantly any of its features (luminosity, size, spectroscopy,...) during the time interval (t1, t2) then the photographs will reveal changes unable to have taken place in only 6 months.

Perhaps the remnants of a supernova are a good candidate body for the experiment but the astrophysicists might know of a better candidate. There must be no significant amount of matter (interstellar gas or dust) between the observed body and the detector (the Earth's atmosphere) because otherwise in both observations the path between the body and such matter will be traveled at the common speed c (relative to that matter).

Physics,"I'm doing a physics project about a car moving at the speed limit and braking. I've found my constant velocity and braking acceleration but I'm stuck on how to actually use these two to find a stopping distance. 
I tried dividing my constant velocity (8.9m/s) by my braking acceleration (-1.6m/s/s). This doesn't seem to make sense and I'm starting to think that I'm NOT supposed to divide the two.

I do have a guess however: 24.75m is my stopping distance? 

Got this through (8.9m/s)/(1.6m/s/s) which gave me a time of -5.5625 seconds. I knew I couldn't have negative time here so I multiplied -5.5625 and -1 to get 5.5625 seconds. Then multiplied my velocity by my time: (8.9m/s)(5.5625s) = 49.50625m. Then I divided 49.50625m by 2 (area of triangle) to get a braking distance of 24.753125m. This rounds to 24.75m.

Physics,"This may be something that many people here relate to, but I haven't found similar threads. That's why I decided to make my own.

Since I was in school, I knew I wanted to do research on quantum gravity. This hasn't changed so far, but as a graduate student who is currently doing her master's in theoretical physics, I'm beginning to see the implications of that choice. Quantum gravity at my university (and probably nearly everywhere else) is basically synonymous with string theory. And having had a lecture on string theory and having done my bachelor's thesis on supergravity made me realize that I don't really like it. It has its valid applications like AdS/CFT, but other than that there are many problems I have with it. These include the missing background independence and the more than 10\^100 possible vacua, which lead to necessary fine-tuning to agree with our guesses(!) for theories of inflation. 

One could now argue that I don't have to agree with physics for it to be true, but string theory isn't proven to be correct. Hell, it's even famously said to be ""not even wrong""! And still I will have to work on it, if I want to do anything closely related to quantum gravity, black hole thermodynamics or cosmology on a graduate level. I even asked a professor about alternatives for master's project and she just told me to ""simply accept the string"". My complaint therefore is the seeming narrow-mindedness, with which this important frontier of physics is tackled by theorists ans which implicitly forces me to follow in their footsteps. Not enough effort is put into exploring alternative theories, including (but not limited to) loop quantum gravity (which I prefer over strings theory but also only cautiously), and comparing results between these. So many assumptions are built only on string theory, that I can't imagine the horror if it turns out that strings (and to an extend supersymmetry) are not the correct way as they are currently thought to be.

Of course we are in this dilemma partially due to a lack of experimental evidence, although the advent of GW detection gives me a spark of hope. But especially in these trying times one should keep their mind open for new ideas and not only things that agree with ones mindset or give the biggest research grants. String theory has it's right to be explored, but so has any other consistent approach to quantum gravity, regardless if they are profitable. But this is a whole different story... I just want to be able to choose what to work on in quantum gravity and not suffer from the biases of the people that came before me.

Physics,"Hi, 

In my physics lectures we are currently covering stationary waves and while I can both decribe how they arise and define nodes and antinodes I actually can´t picture any of it in my head and it bothers me that my understanding is only very shallow. 

The problem is that I probably misunderstand the whole concept of interference... I imagine that when two waves meet they simply combine into a new wave with an amplitude that equals to the sum of each of the original wave´s amplitude - the two iriginal waves are gone and a new one is formed. 

And I had been thinking this the whole time until I saw an animation describing how stationary waves arise. These animations usually picture both of the orginal waves moving in opposite directions and the new one appears only when the two waves happen to be in the same phase. So based on this diagram it basically seems that interference is something that happens only for a split of a second and that the ""new wave"" exists only for a split of a second as well... 

Another thing that led me to believe that my understanding of interference is wrong was the description of nodes and antinodes in terms of being or not being in phase and interference:

a) Where the waves meet in phase, constructive interference occurs so antinodes are formed, which are regions of maximum amplitude. 

b) Where the waves meet completely out of phase, destructive interference occurs and nodes are formed, which are regions of no displacement 

.. so now I feel pretty lost and I was hoping that someone here could put me straight on this matter, my main questions are:

\- how does interference actually work and what exactly is an interference pattern?

\+ clarifiy the nodes and antinodes formation in terms of being or not being in phase and interference

So after a while I came up with that  reasoning: 

&amp;#x200B;

Let us be a Lemon in which we put 1 bar of Zn and 1 bar of Cu. In the Lemon there is naturally an equilibrium between the acid and its ion : AH = A^(-) \+  H^(+). On both sides, the reaction : Metal + 2 AH = Metal^(2+) \+ 2A^(-) are happening and the electrons flow in the cable linked to both metals. 

However, since Zn loses its electrons more easely than Cu, a net current flows from the Zn towards the Cu plates, creating a battery.

Physics,"Hey guys,

So I'm quite fond of the topic of electromagnetic induction. I'm planning to experiment with this topic for my Internal assessment (A physics experiment that we are marked on), but my high school course does not teach me a lot about it and I've been having trouble designing a lab experiment on the same. My focus is experimenting with the Faradays law and I am hoping to calculate the experimental induced EMF with the theoretical. (So my dependent variable is, obviously, the EMF or the voltage, and I have been thinking about my independent variable; the Controlled variable would be every variable in the formula except the EMF and independent variable). I will be using an electromagnetic coil and another neutral coil in which the EMF will be induced.

I have tried an experiment but I was inconsiderate of the variable, especially the rate of change of magnetism or the speed that the coil had. And so I should reframe my query by asking, how do I control my variables. For instance, like the video you sent me changes the 'N' that is the number of turns and let's say I had to do that, I'd have to keep the speed constant, sooo.... for that do I let it go into free fall? or keep the time and distance constant (the time the magnet takes to pass the coil and the length that it covers). Because I'm exploring the effect on X when Y is changed, X could most ideally be the EMF( as that's what faraday's law explores)

and for Y which I'll be changing can be let's say the number of turns 'N' or the Magnetic density 'B' ( I have a gauss meter in my school to measure that).

It'd be great to get advice from someone who is familiar with this topic and any help is appreciated!!

Physics,"So my goal is to complete a PhD in physics (astrophysics is my top interest at the moment, but that will likely change over the years of undergrad). I can either complete a physics degree in 3 years with 1 or 2 electives in computer science/programming and then move into honours and a PhD from there, picking up skills along the way if possible. OR... Complete a double degree in Comp Sys Eng and Physics in 5 years with many courses in programming, embedded computing and circuits/electronics. The time is a fairly significant con of this option, but if it's worth it then I'll be happy to do it. This will give me a strong backup career should I fail to succeed in physics research after a PhD (i.e. a backup career more interesting than software engineering for a company likely to be entirely unrelated to physics), and this is where my questions begin: 

1. Is the engineering component of the degree that beneficial to a physics researcher in, for example, observational or computational astrophysics? Or Plasma physics? 
2. Is it overkill to combine physics with engineering when I could learn plenty of programming and computing skills on my own? 
3. Is the assumption in question 2 that I could learn computing skills on my own a fair one, or is formal education necessary to gain any real skill useful in a backup career after a PhD in physics (not engineering in this case)?

Physics,"
I am having a dispute with my dad because he does not believe my retelling of something that occurred in my high school class last week. I will now say what happened.

We were watching a movie in class when suddenly the kid sitting in front of me seemingly fell unconscious. He was sitting with his chair faced sideways so his back was not resting on anything. He had a sturdy table in front of him. His head began to fall back wards towards me ( sitting at table behind him). Because the top portion of his body fell backwards, his legs lifted up and jammed under the table so his head didn’t completely hit the ground. I thought the chair was acting as a fulcrum so when he fell backwards, it caused his legs to lift up. 

My dad thinks the kid was faking it for attention because when someone falls unconscious, their body goes limp and the legs are not able to move up. I disagree because I think the bone structure in a body would still allow it to act like a normal lever.

Can you guys tell me if physics allows the situation I described, or if the situation I described would not work.

Physics,"I tried asking this in the ELI5 subreddit, but quickly realized that I don't think the true minutiae of the physics problem here was being understood.
Here's the issue: we often see two locomotives coupled to pull a long train, or two tractor trailer cabs hooked front to back to pull a heavy load up a hill.   But I'm just not understanding how this helps halve the load, and here's why: 
Unless the two locomotives or trucks are absolutely perfectly synchronized in to their engine activity, and I mean synchronized to an infinite number of decimal places, there will inevitably be an asynchrony of action. This is especially true because of the imperfect coupling between lead and trailing puller vehicles, but it's even true at a simpler level because of there being two engines driving two different axles.  There will always be a condition where either the lead or the second vehicle are providing slightly more power or providing power out of sync with each other (especially due to naturally imperfect coupling, even if it's nanometers loose). This will set up an induced oscillatory ""push-pull"" situation, where the vehicle providing the power is temporarily pushing or pulling the other vehicle, as well as the full load. There may be a true synchrony of action for a maximum of 1/infinity of a second, as the oscillations to swing past the zero-point (or x axis), but then a push-pull condition will again prevail... And I see this as a problem with anything more than a one single, solid wheel axle doing the moving. Even two axles on the same vehicle cannot possibly be machined and geared and driven to 100.000000....% identical action, and so much more so for two separate vehicles, so there will always be one lagging and one leading prime mover. As such, I don't understand how the locomotive or truck situation works... except for periods of infinitely small x-axis crossings, approaching zero time, there is inevitably going to be asynchrony of pulling force when you chop the time axis into smaller and smaller units.","How exactly can two locomotives coupled and series, or two truck cabs chained back to front pulling a heavy trailer, actually double their power?",1573701186

Where the first moment in y or x is calculated as the double integral of roh * x (or) y (respectively) over some region.

In my intro mechanics course however, I see that the first moment in y or x is calculated as a single integral of x or y (respectively) * dm. From there, dm is adjusted to be a ratio of mass over area or length.

I’m just getting a little confused trying to blend these topics from two different classes. 

I think that in my intro to mechanics course, we must imply that object is very thin. Thus, it’s height/depth must equal 1, so we are left with length and width. 

In the case of a thin rod, height/depth and width = 1, so that leaves us with length.

Physics,"As of right now, the standard QM curriculum is largely based on the historical progression of models. First there was the  ""Plum Pudding"" model, then the Bohr atom, then Schrodinger, and so on. Students are taught every wrong model on the way to the right one. 

You don't see this in other areas of physics education. You don't start at Aristotle before building up to Newton's laws. You don't study the absurd flying machines of the 1890s before learning about aerodynamics. 

The reason we historically had to move through this progression of less-wrong models is because we were reaching in the dark for understanding of something very new and unexpected. We discovered QM by small steps and over many years, because it took a while to interpret what it was we were seeing. But now we have the benefit of hindsight; barring scholarly debates over interpretations of QM we have a pretty solid understanding of everything that's going to be taught up through intro graduate level material.

We expect new students to accept ""Here's F=m*a, this explains how things move"" as a postulate of a theory and just run with it. And it turns out to be a quite successful one at explaining lots of situations even though ti could in principle be derived from ""deeper"" theories.  At some level every physical theory is a model that's based on assumptions. It turns out that the Schrodinger equation is basically an assumption in its own right, just like Newton's 2nd law. And both of them are also only 1st order approximations for more complex phenomena that are more completely modeled by more advanced theories. The only difference is that QM is apparently still ""new"" enough that we feel the need to treat it like a literature review for a developing field rather than a textbook explanation of established theory.

Honestly, I feel like a lot of the hype around QM is self-defeating.

Physics,"""Fundamental mysteries

According to the standard Big Bang model, the universe was born during a period of inflation that began about 13.8 billion years ago. Like a rapidly expanding balloon, it swelled from a size smaller than an electron to nearly its current size within a tiny fraction of a second""

The only thing I can imagine smaller than an electron is a photon. So whatever this thing (photon maybe?) was, what was its origin. How was it created? It's hypothosised that in trillions of trillions of trillions of years from now, everything will disappear and degrade down to the last atom. The universe will be an infinite sea of nothingness due to entropy and gravitational pull. Then when everything reaches absolute zero, not even photons will exist. Not even time will exist because there will be nothing happening and everything will continue to not happen forever.

So if the universe can end and not be able to create anything more, then that must mean that single particle that started the universe must have had an origin.",How was the universe created?,1573000286
Physics,"Graduate student here from Anthropology, doing a PhD. Genuine question here that I feel like only physicists can shed light on. Am in a classic, graduate student, ongoing argument about the existence of things in isolation. The argument that I keep hearing is one that is based on physics, but none of my interlocutors are physicists. So, I thought I would come here to ask the question:

&amp;#x200B;

Has physics come to any conclusions or approximations to conclusions about the existence of anything (matter or conceptual) that can exist in the void, outside of space-time, transcendent to everything but itself? Or does everything *only* exist in relationship-to? A concept of the universe where no*thing* exists, only relationship and thus process? 

&amp;#x200B;

Some of this argument seems to rest on whether or not physics has ever discovered a part of matter that is indivisible. Some people's understanding at the table is that everything physics has ever been able to detect has been shown to be divisible or ""breakable"", right down to the atom. Whereas others seem to believe that physics has shown that things, like electrons, can exist outside of any relationship and thus represent an indivisible entity. 

&amp;#x200B;

The reason why this question is important, from my perspective, is because if there is nothing indivisible, and no entity can exist without a relationship to another entity, then the only aspect to reality that matter IS the relationship -- the entities themselves aren't important. But, if there is something indivisible then the study of things as units matters. 

&amp;#x200B;

Furthermore, if the ""nothing is indivisible"" and ""everything exists only in relation"" is true, then since all relationships are moving through space-time and are never arrested on that plane, then everything only exists as a relationship that is *processual*. 

&amp;#x200B;

Any and all thoughts would be helpful, but sticking as closely to ""what does physics say"" would be good. I know there is a long, long history of theoretical/philosophical thought behind the transcendence. What I am interested in is the ""observed by physics"" part.

If, hypothetically, the Universe is filled with something like Dark matter (i.e. a medium that doesn't interact with light via absorption/emission, but has mass/gravity) wouldn't a ray of light passing through such volume lose energy proportionally to the traveled distance, which would result in a also proportional redshift?

Physics,"I have a sneaking suspicion about the safety of recurring dental x-rays in a relatively healthy mouth, and whether the ~~cancer risk~~ accumulated damage they pose is worth the value they bring. I figure it's probably worth asking smart people on the internet who can help me get to the bottom of this. I'd rather ask physicists than dental or medical practitioners for this one, especially as they have legal, regulatory, insurance-based, financial (reimbursement of $15-$25 per x-ray), or even habit-based incentives to say x-rays are completely safe.

Dental x-rays supposedly give you a radiation dosage of \~5 uSv. 

Last year I had dentist tell me ""you receive more radiation on a 3-4 hour flight"" followed by ""you get a lot of background radiation every year."" I bought it and got the x-rays. It had been a while. Fair enough I thought.

Last week, I went to a new dentist that wanted to give me x-rays again. They said ""you receive more radiation from standing in front of a microwave."" I thought about shutting my mouth for a second. I didn't. ""\[Microwave ovens\] are non-ionizing radiation..."", I told sheepishly them. They disagreed and quickly changed the subject back to scolding me about flossing better.

I'll stick with the first dentist's logic as it's more relevant/plausible. You get 40 uSv on a plane flight from LA to NY (according to an XKCD infographic). That's about a 5hr flight. That's 8 mSv per hour (not accounting for the being at high altitude which is where most of the radioactive exposure happens).

At first glance, that seems fine to me for supporting dental x-rays. The problem I see is the concentration. You have a pinpointed x-ray at your mandible from maybe 2-4cm in distance AND it's not happening over the course of year, a week, or an hour. It's happening in a split-second.

To illustrate my logic through analogy...

You drink 30 gallons of water in a month. Now how about in one sitting with a fire hose?

You lift a 5kg. weight 100 times over two workouts. Now how about 500kg one time and I throw it at your face?

So...

While in school and on the job there's a lot of talk and practice about the BTU's needed to change the state of a substance. Something I've been wondering is how many BTU's would it take for a vapor to turn to plasma? I know the latent heat of evaporation would take 970BTU beyond that I haven't found much info. I asked a former teacher about this and he just blew it off and said it was a stupid question. It may very well be a stupid question but I just wanted to see if anyone knew.

So, I’ll try to make it short. The fastest something can go , defined by Einstein , is light. Ok. So nothing can go faster than that. 
Now let’s give a black hole so much mass, that It not even swallows light, it pulls it back. And now give it more and more mass. At the moment, that a black hole pulls back light , doesn’t that effectively mean that It could possibly accelerate light even faster? I mean the moment it “Sucks“ light from outside the hole into it , the light comes with light speed and should be accelerate if the hole has enough mass ?

The answer is 103. The solution uses a triangle to find the forces and the sine rule to get that. And then, to even further confuse me, the component along b-b' they get is 275!! How can a component be greater than the actual force?

Physics,"I'm currently enrolled in a PhD program in physics, and am in the first semester of my second year. I've been pretty miserable through most of it, and while I know that that isn't unusual I also just don't feel any interest in anything I'm doing anymore. None of the classes are interesting or motivating, I don't feel any drive to go to talks or colloquiums, I don't really see where I want to go with my research, and overall the whole thing just seems kind of blaisé. The only things I have enjoyed are when I've done something relating to astronomy (context: I got a dual degree in undergrad, with a B.S. in physics and a B.S. in astronomy).

So, recently, I started wondering if I had made a mistake going into the physics grad program, if I should have gone into astronomy instead. After talking to some friends about it, they said that maybe I should look into switching programs. So I talked to some faculty that I'm close with in the astronomy department, and they said I should apply to programs if that's what I want to do, but I should finish out this year to get the Masters in physics (I will qualify for that at the end of the year).

My only struggle at this point is telling my PI/advisor. I've worked with him since undergrad, and he's always been really good to me. The only reason I'm even in this grad program is because he fought for me to be in here. Now, he's started talking about trying to get me funding from the collaboration we work for to do research after classes are over. I feel like telling him will make me a huge disappointment and a failure, and I'm scared that it'll ruin our relationship. If I don't get into an astronomy program I was hoping to tough it out and finish through the physics program here, but if he's mad at me for looking at other options I don't know if he'll let me keep doing work under him. He's also always been a strong letter writer for me, and so having him help me with this new round of applications would be great, but again, I'm scared to tell him.

Does anyone have any advice on how to handle this?",How do I tell my PI/advisor that I'm leaving the program,1572356253

Physics,"Hi guys, I hope there are a few of you who are willing to explain this to me.

To give some context, I did an experiment where I attached a weight to the end of a guitar string, while the other end I attached to the top part of my acoustic guitar. My acoustic guitar was slightly tilted, but the guitar string attached to the weight was close enough to it to vibrate the box. The experiment worked nicely, but I don’t understand the theory behind it.

Some people say that the higher the tension, the string is stiffer and so the wave speed increases, but others say that that does not actually matter because it’s actually longitudinal waves that are producing sound and so on.

First of all: does the wavelength decrease so that the frequency increases? Apparently the string vibrates more rapidly which produces a higher pitch but why does that happen? Other articles say that the wave speed remains constant!

Physics,"Hey all,

So it's not a question about physics but rather a methodological question about writing a (physics) report. I usually find it very difficult to choose good articles to express ideas that I know people worked on, but because my work is not focused on those ideas, I don't have much bibliography background for them.

Simple exemple: I am working on swarming behaviours in bacteria suspension and I wish to start my introduction by talking about animal flocks (bird flock, fish flock, etc.) but I don't really know how to choose articles to support that idea. I don't wish to randomly pick the newest article talking about it nor take the first article ever mentionning ""animal"" and ""flocks"" together.

Physics,"I'm an engineering student currently preparing for my physics 1 exam. It consists of kinematics and dinamics, thermo, fluids.

I know there are a lot on the internet, but my professor (best professor I've ever had, to be honest) gives some really haaard exercises in his exams, the kind of exercises with everything in them. For example, if there's an inclined plane then there will be momentum, energy, projectile motion, literally everything in one single exercise, which is probably why to pass you need to complete only 1 out of 3.

So, I was looking for a website which has hard problems that manage to mix up everything, more or less, everything I find on the internet has problems that are only related to one topic (eg energy only).

Also, while I'm grasping the concepts (energy, momentum, how to find missing variables etc...) these get kind of confusing when they are all mixed together, I was doing one of my professor's exams early on and there was this problem where a spring pushes a block on an inclined plane, then it flies off when it reaches the end of the plane and it explodes midway through with two pieces landing somewhere, and while I managed to complete half of the stuff it asked me, at the end I got lost, and the pieces that I was asked to locate once they landed got lost too apparently since I couldn't find their coordinates lol.

Physics,"So I found this out a week ago when I was doing the dishes and messing around with the cups. Basically, the premise of the trick is that you fill a cup up with water, let the bottom of the cup rest on your hand and flip it upside down really fast which causes the cup to shoot up in the air a foot or two. Now I'm not completely sure about the physics on this, but I think this is how it goes. It's all based on whichever newtons law that say that for every action there is an equal and opposite reaction. The premise of this is that gravity makes the water fall out of the cup, which makes the cup go up. Now you can't just flip it over, as it'll just go down with the water. Instead, you have to give it a little upwards momentum as to keep it in the air, but not applying the momentum to the water as well. The lighter the cup and the more water it can hold the better. I find the flimsy plastic cups that you get from Mighty Fine (a burger place) work the best for me. You have to do it just right or it won't work.

Wouldn't that stretching and crushing only appear to occur to you from an outside observer? Has any physicist ever given thought about theoretically being aboard a spaceship that is headed into a black hole?

To someone on Earth you would be stretched, crushed, etc etc... But if you slowly descend into it by orbiting and slowly reducing your orbit, much like we do landing on a planet, I don't believe you would be crushed. Instead, I believe if you looked behind you, you would see the outside universe slowly disappearing, but a new universe (of whatever was sucked into the black hole) slowly appearing in front of you, which would be a normal universe like the one we see today. That is what I think general relativity teaches us, at least to a layman who is just has a B.S. in Electrical Engineering that is.

Yet I never hear of that ever being talked about. Am I missing something about general relativity here?

Physics,"I am not certain this already exists, but I feel like I found a way to generally explain it anyway.

All the infinite timelines eventually loop back to their beginning at the end (duration of timeline &lt; infinity), though they are never exactly the same. No universe is exactly the same as another either and thus none exist in the exact same way. Ripples and echos are as close as we come to perfect replication, if we are viewing a snapshot of multiple similar universes/timelines in this model. 

The multiverse consists of an infinite number of simultaneous universes thus the multiverse's torus (think donut shape) is eternal, in constant simultaneous states of birth, life and death. I haven't done enough torus research to say which type of torus.

The potential paths for a universe through a multiverse have nearly infinite potential shapes in whichever model we choose (universe = [the waves of existence + space + light] &lt; infinity),  but the beginning and end of its timeline are at the core of less than infinite potential space and light within a multiverse (multiverse = [universe x infinity] &lt; [infinity x (space x light)]). 

A timeline in a multiverse could be circular in shape, perpendicular to the multiverse's equatorial plane (the vertical axis of the torus of revolution perpendicular to this central or equatorial plane), its universe expanding to less than infinity from birth at a central core that is infinitely small, the core the universe contracts back into at the end of its timeline. Each universe follows a rule of expansion at its birth and contraction at its death.

The core is infinitely small, but not quite zero (core  &gt; 0). Any point on the most central possible ring of the (infinite) donut (infinut - sounds more like a very long and painful orgasm... we'll work on it), where the hole is smallest, is equal to the core, or this infinitely small number. All timelines and universes start and end at this infinitely small number. 

We can use a 3d model of the 2d symbol for infinity to chart a path less than or potentially equal to infinity through multiple timelines, and thus universes, or by following timelines sequentially.

You can insert the ""light cone model"" into this one.

Physics,"This is a weird question, but bear with me. I always assumed it was normal, but as I was lying in bed looking at the ceiling light I wondered whether it's the same to others.

When I look straight into bright lights, I identify at least 3 layers of ""patterns"":

1: Bright rays composed of smaller rays that clump together depending on how much I squint my eyes, and fade out smoothly. The more I squint, the more they combine into four well defined rays that follow a consistent pattern. They divide the view into 4 quadrants with the light source as the origin. The ""positive y"" axis of this coordinate system actually forms a V shape, but if I look with just one eye, the V shape disappears and I see a | shape, defining four quadrants. This is consistent with both eyes. I'm not sure what causes this.

2: A bright halo around the light. The burriness varies in intensity, depending on how open my eyes are. It tends to ""fade out"" if I open my eyes fully, but never completely fading out. I always suspected this to be normal. I know this can mean vision problems.

3: I see what strongly resembles an oscillating magnetic field around the light. Unlike the others, I need to look into the light for a while for it to appear clearly. Given the nature of light, this intrigues me. What causes this?

The duration of one universe is less than or (potentially) equal to infinity, which is an ever expanding donutsphere when looked at as the foundation of the multiverse. You can use a 3d symbol of Infinity to chart the essential path of any universe through the multiverse. Each follows a rule of expansion and contraction (on an infinite timeline).

A timeline of a universe begins at this plane, meets it again at some point after it begins and before its end, and at the end. 3 points on a line where the first and last are the same if the line becomes a loop of some construction. An aggregate timeline would be circular.

So, let’s thing about a particle between two planets that have the exact same mass and are the same distance of this particle, this particle would experience none gravitacional pull since both planets are pulling it with the same “force”, therefore the particle is in equilibrium, is this right? 
So since a particle can be pull by 2 different gravitacional forces, the total gravitacional pull can be manipulated. Like the earth pulls you at 9.8 m/s^2, but if the moon was suddenly huge and had a gravitational pull of 2 m/s^2 you would be pull to the earth at just 7.8 m/s^2, I know that gravity it’s not exactly a force, but if this is true we could manipulate a photon inside a black hole’s event horizon.
Light cannot escape the event horizon because the escape velocity is bigger than the speed of light, but if another black hole got just close enough so the total gravitation pull of the first black hole in the photon would be less than the speed of light this photon could escape the black hole even if it has been inside the event horizon. It is a really specific situation, but when two black holes are colliding it could happen.

Physics,"So recently I've been thinking about the effect of time dilation between two objects in motion. For simplicity, I'm only considering the special relativity effect of relative velocity. Now, from my understanding, special relativity tells us that an object moving relative to another object, or point in space, will experience, but not feel, a decrease in passage of time from the perspective of a ""stationary"" observer. Note that stationary is in quotations since there is no true ""stationary"" frame in space, only relative frames (correct me if I'm wrong).   

Let's place two astronauts right next to one another, each with their own atomic clock. They confirm to one another that both of the atomic clocks are synchronized (or at least synchronized to a known accuracy). The two astronauts fly off in different directions at high speeds relative to one another (lets say 0.5c). 

Now, astronauts A and B both confirm that they are moving away from one another but the question of *who* is moving is relative. Astronaut A could say that he is stationary and astronaut *B* is flying away. However, astronaut B could say the opposite. In the first claim, where astronaut A states he is stationary, the passage of time for astronaut B would be slower then the passage of astronaut A's own time from astronaut A's perspective. So in this case, if astronaut A asks astronaut B ""what time does your clock say?"" astronaut B would report a time that was slightly behind the time astronaut A sees.

Lets take a look at the other case, where astronaut B claims he is stationary and astronaut *A* is moving away. It would be fair to assume that if astronaut B asked astronaut A to read out his displayed time, it would be behind astronaut B's time. From the perspective of astronaut B, he is staying still and astronaut *A* is moving away from *him.* 

If the two astronauts come back together and place the clocks right next to one another to debate their claim of who actually experienced a dilation in time, what would they see? Which clock would be ahead? or would either of them be ahead? I keep repeating this thought experiment in my head to no avail and I'm very interested to know if anyone has figured it out.

The question is what is the void made of? Of all visible matter creates stars, planets, comets, then what lies in the space in between? We call it void, but we can travel through it, so we need to move in ""something"". Maybe the answer lies only on quantum level.

Physics,"I honestly don't really know if this is the right place to post this. But I have a question regarding a 3D object entering a 4th dimension.

So basically we can imagine how a 3D-object would look like when it's passing through a 2D world. Let's say that the object itself is a ball. In 2D, the ball itself would appear fist as a small dot getting bigger and bigger until the center of its' mass has passed through the 2D, and then the circle would keep getting smaller and smaller until it has passed through the dimension.

Now to my question. As we live in a 3D world and we are able to grab objects physically. We know that matter cannot disappear but only transform in to other matter. Even if my ball would pass through from a the third dimension to a fourth one, (and I hope that I have understood this correctly), the actual matter of the ball would not change, but only transform.

So.. In conclusion, what would happen if I held on to my ball and wrapped my body around it as it would enter a 4th dimension? Would I follow the ball or would the ball simply disappear alongside the actual matter of it, and in such case what would fill up the void of the space where the baöö once was? And would I eventually just be clinging on to air?

If I am completely off here and I've missed something vital(which would not suprise me), please explain it to me as you would explain to a 7 year old kid that wants to know why he or she can't have anything he or she points on.

And no, I do not have any high degree in science nor physics.",Question regarding an object entering a 4th dimension.,1563919227
Physics,"Hey guys,

I`ve always wanted to learn how to draw, but never found the time for it. Lately School wasn`t so busy so I had more freetime than usual. So I`ve asked my art-teacher for some advice and his tips were extremely helpful. I wont list them up here because I am sure there are plenty of good tips in this group and it wont be necessary. However one of his tips helped me the most: It is listening to calm music ( Lo-Fi, piano, etc...) while drawing or sketching. This actually really surprised me, because I always thought that music distracts you from what you are trying to do, especially if it is something new or difficult. But I thought it might be worth giving it a try so i found a good Lo-Fi playlist and a good piano playlist on Spotify and I was surprised how easily I could work when I was listening to them. I figured that the Lo-Fi playlist worked out best for me because it is a little bit more energetic than piano, but this is only my personal opinion. I talked to my art-teacher the following week, and he told me, that calm music helps you to be more focused and more creative, no matter what you do while listening to this music. So it`s not just the obvious things, like art or programming when music is useful, but it actually helped me to prepare for my exams too, because I could memorize things quicker.

And because all of you are interested in learning new skills, I thought this could be helpful to quite a lot of you.

Physics,"So I was learning why atoms emit light and this is what I came across :-

 ""Light is the result of electrons moving between defined energy levels in an atom, called shells. When something excites an atom, such as a collision with another atom or a chemical electron, an electron may absorb the energy, boosting it up to a higher-level shell. **The boost is short-lived, however,** and the electron immediately falls back down to the lower level, emitting its extra energy in the form of an electromagnetic energy packet called a photon. The wavelength of the photon depends on the distance of the electron’s fall. Some wavelengths, such as radio waves, are invisible. Photons with wavelengths in the visible spectrum form all the colours that we can see"" - from [this](https://www.howitworksdaily.com/how-do-atoms-emit-light/) site.

Physics,"Hello All,

I  have found myself in a tough situation after graduating from  university. I graduated a few months ago with a BS in Mathematics and BA  in Physics (had all requirements for a BS except a lab course that  overlapped with another required course so could not take) from a  prestigious research institution (not ivy but a top-tier public  university). I earned sub-par marks my freshmen-junior year in my major  coursework; I failed a core class and earned a failing grade due to a  honor court mishap in an elective course (although all evidence points  to this being unfounded but decided to not go through with the  convoluted appeals process).

I  earned better grades my senior year (2.9 cumulative) and participated  in particle physics research for roughly 1.5 semesters. I have realized  my intense passion for theoretical physics (still uncertain as to  whether I would rather conduct research in HEP/particle physics or  gravitational physics/cosmology). I have spent the summer studying for  the PGRE, filling in knowledge gaps from ugrad courses, and completing  the readings and problem sets from Griffiths Elementary particles text  and the remaining material from Munkres Topology we did not cover in the  course. I have allowed myself to explore papers in the aforementioned  fields even though I realize mastery of the fundamentals/filling in  knowledge gaps is paramount.

I  find myself ruminating on my ugrad blunders with deep regret and my  apparent lack of foresight. I am keen on pursuing a doctorate in physics  but was fully aware I was not qualified or prepared to do so directly  after ugrad.

My  current state: I accepted an analyst position with an aerospace  contractor. I have been researching post-bac programs that I could  partake in while working and masters programs that I could apply to for  fall 2020.  However, with a lackluster gpa(including the two  aforementioned blunders this comes out to a 2.4) and no publications  with the research I participated in, it seems my options are slim to  none. Even if I score in the high percentile of GRE/PGRE, it seems my  poor ugrad record will hinder any chance I have at getting into a  masters program. Will working in the aerospace industry for 1-2 years  potentially offset this poor coursework performance and give me a shot  in getting into a masters program then re-apply for a doctorate program?  The questions I am hoping to receive advice on are:

\- Would taking post-bac/visiting student courses in physics/math while working be at all beneficial?

\-  Is it feasible to participate in research at one of the several  universities in the area while working and not currently enrolled in a  graduate program?

Physics,"At some point in my life I got it into my head that there is an inverse relationship between how quickly a substance decays and how harmful the radiation from that substance was per unit of time. Basically, shorter half-life = more danger. This would seem to make sense. A shorter half-life would mean more atoms are decaying per unit of time, which would mean more potentially dangerous particles emitted per unit of time. The problem is that I simply have no idea how or when I learned this. And I have on occasions been given cause to doubt this. Often, when emphasizing how dangerous radiation can be, people will often cite the lengthy half-life of some of the isotopes. For example, in the recent show ""Chernobyl"" a character mentions that the area will not be safe withing their lifetimes because the half-life of Plutonium 239 is 24 thousand years.

Physics,"I'm a bit of a YouTube armchair physicist and joined this subreddit just to ask a question that's been bugging me for a while. Sorry if it seems a bit amateur.

&amp;#x200B;

I've never understood why we're able to experience (see) the universe expanding. My understanding is that there is dark matter, which we don't know much about, but it appears to be creating 'extra' space throughout the universe, pushing everything apart and expanding the universe. I'm aware of the huge oversimplification of my summary, but bear with me.

&amp;#x200B;

Let's use the ant on a  balloon hypothesis. If you place an ant on a deflated balloon and inflate it, assuming the ant had some kind of conscious awareness of it's surroundings, it would experience the balloon expanding underneath it. It would realise that the distance between any two points on the balloon were getting further and further apart.  

&amp;#x200B;

But that's because the ant is not part of the balloon. The ant is a separate entity from the balloon. It's outside of the fabric of the balloon and is therefore not being affected by the expansion (inflation) of the balloon. It can experience it from the outside looking in, so to speak.

&amp;#x200B;

But if we could somehow weave the ant into the fabric (in this case, rubber) of the balloon, and make the ant a part of the balloon, then as the balloon expanded, so would the ant. The proportion of ant to balloon would remain exactly the same, and would make it impossible for the ant to be aware of the balloons expansion, because both the ant and the balloon would be expanding at the same rate.

&amp;#x200B;

I guess what I'm trying to say is, why do we appear to only see the space between objects (galaxies) expanding, and not the objects themselves? Why does the space inside atoms not expand? If everything in the universe, including the 'empty' space (I know there's not really such a thing) and the objects within it, including us, were all expanding at the same rate, there is no way we could be aware of it's expansion. 

&amp;#x200B;

Another principle of quantum physics, entanglement, fits well with the fundamental Buddhist and New Age spiritual principle that all things are one. The principle of entanglement is that two quantum particles, like electrons, can correlate their behavior with each other at great distances. For example, take the property called “spin” of the electron. The spin of one entangled particle can be predicted if the spin of the other entangled electron is known. In fact, quantum physics experiments have found that electrons correlate their behavior with each other at speeds faster than light. These experiments have not found a limit on the speed with which one particle correlates its behavior with another. The correlation of behavior may be instantaneous. Here’s an article on a recent entanglement experiment that has further strengthened the evidence for this phenomenon.

Physics experiments have ruled out the possibility that the two electrons are pre-programmed. If the entangled particles were pre-programmed, they would come in matched pairs, like if one glove is for the right hand, the other, of course, is for the left. However, experiments have ruled out this explanation. Physicists have not come up with a theory to explain entanglement. Possibly, such a theory could derive from the spiritual principle that, at bottom, all things are one.

Other Aspects of Quantum Physics Which Relate to Spirituality

There are several other key aspects of quantum physics that fit well with spiritual principles. Perhaps, the most important is that quantum particles are in a state of potentiality, possibly having this property and possibly becoming having that property, until they interact with some aspect of the physical universe. Only then, do they enter our physical reality as a particle with definite properties. This aspect of quantum physics may connect with the spiritual idea that our intentions, conscious or subconscious, causes potential realities to manifest. For more on this aspect of quantum physics, read about Quantum Field Theory.

Now let me clarify, I dont really have a stance because I have absolutely no knowledge on what quantam mechanics are, and I didnt really understand what any of this meant partially because my english isnt too good, so can someone give me an explanation on whether what is said here is valid or not (the field theory thing i really didnt get) and whats being said?","Question on quantam entanglement, field theory, etc?",1562763251

I have always been interested in nukes and especially the ""dial a yield"" designs. I'm a little confused on the thermo nuke vs their triggers, the atom bombs.

Now I understand why we use Neutron reflectors, but I recently watched a video that said the fusion of tritium / deuterium sole purpose was to send yet more neutrons back into the plutonium core, increasing efficiency and thus increasing yield.   


Side thought: If you could theoretically increase efficiency of a nuke to where 100% of the core goes fissile, I do wonder what that yield would be??

Basically, my ultimate goal is to understand the universe, like most academic physicists. I want to understand quantum mechanics, relativity, the mathematics describing singularities, etc. However, I am also very much into machine learning. I find it awesome that neural networks are becoming so powerful, and the achievements of deep learning are astounding. It seems that we are approaching some sort of technological singularity. Now, I was watching a talk by a key person at DeepMind named Demis Hassabis (one of the founders), and he actually also stated that he believed physics to be the ultimate subject. He said that scientific fields such as physics are becoming so specialized that it is almost impossible to make large-scale progress that advances the whole field, bringing us to a Theory of Everything. He claims (and I agree with him), that machine learning, especially reinforcement learning, can be used to create a sort of super-intelligent AI that will eventually be able to solve complex theoretical problems, and he said this is one of the ultimate goals of AI/science. I know this may sound a bit sensationalist, but neural nets have been shattering even the most optimistic predictions in terms of their capabilities. 

I guess what I'm asking is this: is it possible that by studying machine learning I can so something I'm passionate about, and progress towards my ultimate goal of understanding the fundamental laws of the universe?

I’m producing a kids science TV show and our episode is about the science of boats. One segment is supposed to test whether the magnetic rock magnetite may be able to effect the compasses of ships that pass over large deposits of the rock.

It naturally has to be “big” for TV so we’re attempting to use a junk yard magnet to demonstrate the effect on compasses from various distances to mimic various depths of water.

We had a geologist who studies magnetite help design this experiment but apparently his knowledge of magnetism itself is a big lacking. We went to the junk yard to test the experiment this morning and the magnet had very little effect on the compass.

I assume that part of the issue is that a junk yard magnet probably has a very directional magnetic pull so that, if the compass is off to the side, it would quickly be outside of the magnet’s effect.

We can’t tilt the magnet sideways. It must be facing down. We were told that, if we tilt the compass on its side, the needle should point down into the earth and that, if we put it directly under the magnet, the needle would be drawn upwards towards the magnet. This doesn’t happen. It moves a bit but not very much.

While I was reading a couple of things, never got satisfied by the depth of these explanations about the ""negative"" and ""positive"" charge particles carry. I know they just represent a convention because it turns out that is was just too late to easily change such terminology...  


Although, they mean to really constitute those particles behavior as far as attraction or repelling is concerned. And I just cannot find the answer as to why some particles happen to be on one side (""negative"") and ones on the other ""positive"".   


Let's drop the ""negative"" and ""positive"", they are just confusing terms. And let's say ones are protons and others are electrons. They do not have ""negative"" or ""positive"" charge per say... They just have charge.   


So, one electron has an electrical field which exerts force on other charges in the field. Ok, but what decides which type of ""force"", attraction or repelling, will take place? And why does the proton do not have an electric field for himself?

In Hong Kong there was an incident where a water truck flipped over (I'm pretty sure it was) because the driver switched lanes too suddenly. The driver was trying to get in front of a double decker bus on the highway, and because it was a water truck..the water was sloshing left and right in the truck, causing the truck to become unbalanced and wobbly.

A video of the incident is [here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uOEdSjbiuuA).

&amp;#x200B;

So I'm wondering how could this have been prevented (besides the driver not switching lanes so suddenly). So after he had already switched lanes, the water already was creating an imbalance in the truck because the water was sloshing around... so... would slowing down suddenly, or gradually have prevented the truck from flipping over? Could the driver have swerved side to side to kind of even out the water imbalance? Or after switching lanes, was there nothing the driver could have done to prevent flipping over? 

I'm trying to understand what happened and how it could have been prevented in a ""physics"" sense... so like talking about motion and physics stuff. But I don't know ANYTHING about physics, so that's why I'm here on this subreddit.

Here is an opportunity to make your voices heard in how to streamline your research compliance burden! 

Despite the streamlining of some government regulation and federal agency policies and the institution of electronic means of submission for various documents, there is still an increase in the amount of time reported by the Federal Demonstration Partnership for compliance activities by faculty to 44.3% as of 2018. The purpose of the survey is to determine which of the compliance functions take the most time or contain the most redundancy; and to hear the opinions of faculty, post-doctoral associates, graduate students, and professional researchers/technicians on if the current facilities available to them are enough. From these answers, I intend to develop a set of best practices that to research administration offices throughout the United States can utilize to better assist with workflow, time management, and resource/direction planning. 

This project is a requirement to complete my Masters in Science (Research Administration) Thesis, titled, “Determining primary time drivers for compliance functions in non-medical-trial STEM research, and determining best practices for reducing faculty time investment”, with Dr. Jeffrey Kantor at Johns Hopkins University. As the research component of the thesis, I am seeking faculty volunteers who are conducting STEM research that does not include medical trials to answer a short survey.

Physics,"A friend of mine wants to know and I tried figuring it out, but I figured a second opinion was warranted. 

A few assumptions: ghosts are incorporeal, meaning having no matter. The motion detector in question works off of detecting differences in infrared light. 

My reasoning: 

Light is not matter but energy, and so can be said to be incorporeal. Because light (specifically infrared) triggers the sensor, it is feasible that an incorporeal ghost would too. 

This next part I’m sure will make all of you smart people facepalm, because I really don’t understand it. But according to Einstein’s mass-energy equivalence, would it be fair to say that mass and energy are two versions of the same thing, just like how ice and water are both the same thing?  If so, we have a completely massless object, an incorporeal object, m=0. E=0C^2, the result should be E=0 or there is no energy. I know I’ve fundamentally misunderstood something because photons are massless yet still carry energy.

Physics,"I came up with this idea I wanted to know your opinions. If my grammar is sloppy I am sorry I am not a native speaker.

Suppose you want to know if two events happened at the same time. Einsteins theory of special relativity postulates that there is not a universal clock that keeps track of the pace of every object in a system unlike classical mechanics. Every observer has a particular own time and there is no preferred time, this arises because the speed of light is a constant for all inertial observers. A question like how to measure two simultaneous events doesn’t make sense at all. But if you really wanted two know if two events happened at the same time then I believe that you could set up an imaginary universal master clock that ignores relativistic time dilation either gravitational time dilation or time dilation by relativistic speeds.

I believe that to answer the question how can you be sure that two events where synchronized; is possible with a hypothetical universal master clock similar to the idea from classical mechanics, but if special relativity says such thing is incorrect, then how can this question be answered? Well i believe in the universal master clock of classical mechanics can still work if you assume it is hypothetical

if you see special relativity as a way of saying how slower or faster is the internal frequency of events for every observer say the internal chemicals of a rock moving at 78% the speed of light must react at a different pace than the chemical reactions of objects in other frames of reference, or the chemical reactions of a rock vary at their pace when they are in a gravitational field

Back to the hypothetical clock, this clock could if my interpretation is correct still exist because it is hypothetical. In real life relativistic effects would mess it up(in real life idk how would you run it) Say you set this imaginary hypothetical measurement device where you measure for every single cubic meter of space a second. Take a second to be from now on : “the duration of 9,192,631,770 periods of the radiation corresponding to the transition between the two hyperfine levels of the ground state of the caesium 133 atom” then apply it from some time x, for ever, for every piece of space in the universe. In our universe considering the relativistic frequency dilation of events this wouldn’t work, it would eventually mess this up. If you started to run this machine and could measure every event as a coordination of oscillations then you wouldn’t violate relativity you would just establish a hypothetical frame of measurement in a place where relativistic effects are still happening. If you would coordinate blinks with another person at this universal clock time at exactly the same number of oscillations say the universe doesn’t have gravitational or speed dilation with a margin of error of 0 in other words because the universal clock is measuring for all the objects in the system then say an event happened at oscillation 99 and another was measured to have happened at oscillation 99 then you could technically say they where coordinated. 

Note: don’t interpret this as me saying special relativity is wrong, it doesn’t have to do with that, as far as i believe this is just a framework of measurement this is I believe a hypothetical scenario just as Maxwell’s entropy demon. special relativity has been proven and its a truly beautiful framework that unified Galilean relativity with Maxwells equations, and it’s even more profound than that myself I have a hard time understanding it. 

This universal event synchronization clock can’t work in our universe because there exist time dilation that changes the oscillations that would keep this clock synchronizing events. special and general relativity that are mathematical frameworks predicts and measures this “de-synchronization” for macroscopic objects. 

Considering you could divide time into smaller and smaller chunks, then your probability of synchronization would become 0. I believe as far as i understand measuring time smaller than planck time isn’t possible in our universe because you would need to measure time in a space so small in fact smaller than the planck scale that a black hole would form predicted by the uncertainty principle

This machine framework is a solution to the question of how to measure the synchronization of two simultaneous events in our universe and it would still technically but I don’t know if it is even possible to set such a machine and even then SR and GR come into play. although it wouldn’t be infinitely accurate for synchronizing blinks it could be if possible to develop such a machine master clock,  a very good option for measuring event coordination anyways in my opinion.

Considering the universe is made up of fields where events happen QFT and because QFT is correlated and uses special relativity then I hope this idea can help produce new ideas like for example: Particles are just perturbations in fields that evolve I believe according to the dirac equation. These perturbations are at a different pace for fields in a gravitational field or for fields or “particles” moving at high speeds where they effectuate differently and GR predicts all of these consequences.

Anyways I had a question is the dirac equation a predictor of the evolution of the relativistic perturbations in any field of QFT?",Hypothetical clock for measuring simultaneous events?,1562046309

&amp;#x200B;

&gt;In addition to what Tim and Oliver have said, I'd just like to add a couple of comments. In my honest opinion, Deceleration is a horrendous term and one which causes unnecessary confusion. It is best to just confine yourself to acceleration. Indeed, beyond high school physics or mechanics, I would be surprised if you hear the term “deceleration” used by a teacher, mathematician, physicist, engineer etc. In any case, the term deceleration means the “opposite” of acceleration and is therefore somewhat redundant. When thinking about positive and negative acceleration, it often simplifies matters if you think of velocity, rather than speed. Then, a positive acceleration means than the velocity is increasing and a negative acceleration means that the velocity is decreasing.  
  
&gt;  
&gt;Reference [https://www.physicsforums.com/threads/what-does-negative-acceleration-really-mean.524267/](https://www.physicsforums.com/threads/what-does-negative-acceleration-really-mean.524267/)

&amp;#x200B;

Found this comment from 'Hootenanny' on Physics Forums which summed up a lot of my words. The use of deceleration to represent a negative change of the magnitude of velocity reinforces in a lot of students' minds the association of acceleration with speed rather than velocity. This association lingers far too long after learning introductory high school physics; I recently was learning about the force exerted on moving charges by external magnetic fields and learned that the force is a cross product of (drift) velocity and the external magnetic field. The professor clarified that speed does not change if acceleration is perpendicular to velocity. He then related magnetic force to centripetal force in the case of no other forces and constant charge speed. It took far longer than it should have for this concept to sink in because my mind kept instinctively associating acceleration with speed rather than velocity.  At first, I kept wondering how speed didn't change despite a perpendicular force; if acceleration was present, I knew velocity was changing, but the connotation of acceleration in regards to speed kept tripping me up; I kept trying to apply kinematic equations when I should have been thinking in terms of position vectors and their derivatives.

&amp;#x200B;

The term negative acceleration is just as bad. I believe the term emphasizes signage too much and detracts from the understanding of basic physics concepts, particularly Newton's second law of motion. Part of this is due to the arbitrary nature of signs in physics. Forgive me if I'm wrong, but I think I read somewhere in one of my textbooks that charge signs, for example, are arbitrary. Switching signs would change practically none of modern physics knowledge, only changing certain stuff like conventional current, I'd imagine (since if signs were reversed, conventional current would now follow the direction taken by electrons rather than being denoted by the direction opposite of electron flow).

&amp;#x200B;

The occasionally arbitrary nature of signs in physics is prone to cause confusion in elementary physics. For example, a student learning physics for the first time will likely associate ""up"" with positive values. However, gravity points ""down"". Using negative acceleration to describe acceleration pointing in the direction opposite of what was decided positive can cause confusion, particularly since forces such as gravity tend to increase the magnitude of velocity when objects are dropped on Earth. Combined with the positive nature of all magnitudes and the heavy use of magnitudes vs vectors in early physics education, the term of negative acceleration makes topics such as Newton's second law of motion unclear. Newton's second law of motion can be described as the sum of all forces on an object must equal the net force on an object, or the mass of an object multiplied by its net acceleration. The magnitudes of two given opposing forces A and B on a stationary object (such as all forces in 1D kinematics) could be described as A + B = 0, but given that the equations used at that level of physics typically rely on magnitudes, A = B could potentially be an easier way for students to understand the second law of motion. For example, if three strings, C, D, and E were tied up into a knot and a mass hung stationary from the lowest string E (imagine the letter Y; the junction is the knot, C and D are the upper strings, and E is the string at the bottom on which a mass is hung), it would be easier for me to think that the vertical magnitudes of the two upper strings' tensions are equal to the vertical magnitude of the lower string's tension (C-vertical + D-vertical = E-vertical) than try to unintentionally learn superposition (C + D + E = 0) if I hadn't learned vector-based physics yet. I believe negative acceleration is a concept that is more palatable with the erudition that comes with learning additional physics, but it is a potentially detrimental concept for elementary students of physics.

Physics,"Hi everyone!

I would like to know the important and unsolved problems in physics (especially involving relativity,QM and Particle Physics)",Greetings to the Physics community! Looking for some suggestions,1561466019
Physics,I've been reading over articles regarding the [shape of the universe](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shape_of_the_universe) and now I'm getting confused regarding this and general relativity. When reading over the 'shape of the universe' information I assumed they were referring to how the universe could be curved in a 4th (spatial) dimension. This would be like showing that parallel lines tend to move towards/away from each other or how the angles of a triangle in space won't add to 180 (just like the analog of a seemingly flat earth locally actually being curved in a third dimension and having these properties). But then I saw how general relativity refers to 'intrinsic curvature' of space-time and therefore doesn't need a fourth spatial dimension to 'curve into'.  And also general relativity relates to geodesics and how beams of light won't follow straight paths just like mentioned earlier (but for GR it's only in reference to when mass is nearby I think). So what am I mixing up here? Is general relativity just referring to local curvature while the shape of the universe is an issue of the global topology? Is the shape of the universe actually an intrinsic curvature as well? Sorry for the several questions. Not a physicist but really enjoy this stuff and as a result the questions just started building.,Is the shape of the universe related to general relativity?,1561459954

Since in holographic principle, entropy (information) from a bulk would be encoded on its boundary, and according to this study holographic screens would not behave according to thermodynamics, wouldn't holographic principle models also be affected by these results?

Physics,"I organized my original post. Also categorized content by topic. And added a math section. 

I organized the math section by what I believe to be learning from 'first principals.' This is partially inspired by Schuller's horribly intuitive approach to theoretical physics in his lecture series. That being said, r/math will probably grill me as I might screw up the prerequisite structure or whatever.

The universe we live in today is energy dominant. Take a proton, most of its mass is in the bonding energy of its quarks. We see matter being obliterated and becoming energy. There is also phenomenon in which light becomes matter. Could it be that the energy that's being captured by black holes is somehow being transformed into matter, or maybe even a more exotic condensed form denser than matter?
As all of the ""stuff"" in the universe gets converted from its more expanded form into its more condensed form, the universe is stretched. Where the ""stuff"" was occupying space a void was left, so ""space"" itself stretches to fill it. (Quotes around space to distinguish the space an object occupies, and the space in which expansion occurs.).

Right now the black holes are increasing in number and size. So, the the rate at which the energy is condensed is increasing. This is increasing the stretching or expansion of space. As the black holes become more dominant, thus leading to more condensed stuff, the rate of expansion will slow and eventually stop. 

At that point, the universe will be completely dominated by black holes. Gravity having an infinite range, but diminishing effect, couldn't keep up with the condensing rate. Now that everything is condensed, even though space is now stretch immeasurably, gravity will take over thanks to its infinite range. What happens when everything is then gathered?

I'm sure there are many flaws to these theories. I love discussing these things, though. Thanks for reading.",Could black holes be driving the expansion?,1560836153

Physics,"So I have been applying for PhD positions and after a lot of negative responses, I got one positive response. He emailed me that he had a job opening coming up soon, and if I would be interested.  Naturally I said yes and we scheduled for a skype interview a week later as he was travelling.  I chose the first date he was free and whatever time he was comfortable with and never showed any delays in my responses or if he asked something.  Last week I do the interview,  he says I'll be taking you on and right after the interview he started sending me official documents and asking me for things lile transcripts, diplomas, etc. Things were going well. He was very responsive over the email, and we had started taking care of formalities. He jotted out my project themes and even gave me some stuff to look at as well. So 2 days after the interview,  he asks me to update my CV to have my 'Place of birth' in it. Now here's the thing, i messed up big time here. I gave him the incorrect place of birth. The thing is I have spent my childhood in two cities. We stayed in one city first then in other. This is how I remembered it. But turns out I was born in the other city even though we never really lived that long there. Now, I have never usually needed to put down my place of birth anywhere before except a passport or something, but I got it so long back that maybe my dad filled up the documents regarding that. So I always thought the my place of birth was something else. And we relocated 3 times so it's not that I have always lived there. No coming back to the story, after sending gime the updated CV a day after he sends me some more official documents and they have my place of birth there. By a great fortunate chance, I was home for a festival and when I printed out those documents my dad casually had a look over. This is such an impossible thing, I never would have shown him this, but he goes like, ""umm... you were born in ____ not ____"" . And I just froze, so almost all my life I had known it wrong way and  might have given this inaccurate information God knows where. I search for my birth certificate and passport and there they have it. I was wrong all along. 
Now, I am not underplaying this issue and I understand that this has to be the dumbest shit anyone could do. And I perhaps just proved to him, how incompetent I was at doing my life, let alone a PhD. If I can't get basic facts right how am I to be trusted. So I was pretty much expecting a big NO or some demand for a good explanation or something, but it was obvious he won't be interested after this.

But since we were so far ahead in terms of formalities I thought maybe if I could prove that it was an honest mistake and how I made it, maybe just maybe he could excuse me. Anyway, gathering my strength, I write up an apology email informing him of the blunder on my part and sent him the updated information and birth certificate and passport.  Now at this point a simple rejection was easily an outcome.

But what I never expected was to be ghosted. He never replied. A day after i sent an email to his secretary informing her of the issue and apolgies and something they had asked for. But still no response. 

I sent him two more emails with some documents that they had asked earlier on. And even asked two questions in the last email. But still no response. They could have at least let me know, instead of giving me anxiety. Whatd do you guys think?",PhD supervisor ghosted me after accepting me,1553741564

[Forces On a Simple Pendulum \(F is tension\)](https://i.redd.it/kp3npjocdqo21.jpg)

Here recently I have been working on programming a physics framework for simulations, but I've ran into a problem...

I was testing forces, so I created a simple pendulum like in the photo, and I created the two forces acting on it, the force of tension and the force of gravity...

When the angle of the pendulum starts at 0 degrees, everything seems fine, the tension force is equal to the gravitational force and the bob of the pendulum is in equilibrium (not moving), but as soon as I raise the bob, I notice a ""problem"".

Lets say I raise it up 90 degrees, and let it go, as soon as I let it go, the gravitational force starts accelerating the bob downwards, and the tension force is 0, therefore, the bob gains a velocity downwards.... as the angle starts to decrease though, instead of the bob slowing down, it just keeps traveling downwards, it reaches a sort of terminal velocity.

The force of tension and the force of gravity are equal and opposite, therefore there is no acceleration, but the bob of the pendulum also already had a velocity downwards, so now it just keeps traveling down with no net force to slow it down...

How does the tension of the string stop the bob from going down any further if the bob already had a downwards velocity, because the tension force can't slow it down because the tension force can only have a magnitude of the weight of the bob?

Physics,"Hey Reddit. I just had a fix Idea and I cant imagine, that im the first one to think about this. But it really keeps me wake so I just have to write down my thoughts.

&amp;#x200B;

To come close what i want to say, first imagine a Programm like everyone could write it. It calculates the possible combinations of characters of a lets say 5 Char long String. So it starts to write an AAAAA, AAAAB, AAAAC and so on, and ends with ZZZZZ. Now this Programm wrote all the possibilities how a 5 Char long String can be formed. There is much gibberish in it like FJWCM. But we also find all Words with 5 Characters which we also find in a Dictonary. Words like ""GOALS"" or ""SPORT"".

&amp;#x200B;

Now how many different Words did the programm Write down? For some Mathcracks like you its easy: 5 exp 26 = 11881376.

&amp;#x200B;

Lets do this with a Picture. I keep it simple so we only take 256 possible colors and 200x200 pixels. We start with: White,White,White,White.....White, White,White,White,White.....Gray, White,White,White,White....Colored go over to White,White,White...Black, we pass White,White,White...Black,White and so on.

&amp;#x200B;

So we get this Number:

&amp;#x200B;

256exp200\*200= 3.96837288908982959632720008766809726987827040181737 × 10\^96329 (my goodness, i hope i got that right)

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

So as soon as this picture goes black, we now got it. We got a picture that contains everything. It contains a photo of the birth and the death of the Universe. Your birth, your death and every millisecond of your body rotting. It contains a photo of me writing this Post while eating French Fries, and of everyone of you reading it. But even more, it contains a Photo of everybody that has ever visited Reddit and they are all reading this Post, even if most of them will never do. And a Version where everyone of them eats French Fries. It contains the full Triology of Lord of the Rings but this time I played everybody, even Saurons Eye (which would be Blue) out of every possible perspective...And a Photo of you watching this Movie, and a Photo of somebody watching you watching this movie while Rubbing his belly, his head, his hands and hell yeah we are on the Internet, even his cat and every cat ever existed in every perspective that exists.

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

And now to my point.

&amp;#x200B;

Lets imagine, that we would have all the factors of the Universe. I mean: We know exactly how big it is. We know exactly how many possible Atoms there are and what they are made of. We know exactly what the smallest distance the slowest object travels in the smallest possible amount of time. We know how Protons and Neutrons can be loaded, how they can travel. We can calculate the possibilitys things can react with.

&amp;#x200B;

And now we start our gigantic Calculation. Exponenting until we got every possibility. We dont now shit. The Number would be so big, that it may contain a googolplex. Twice. But here we are. The biggest Number that is possible. Nothing more, nothing less. To make it short, i just call it a Peppl until someone of you prooves, that i havent been the first one to invent the Peppl. But just in case, its a Peppl, because that sounds cool. Every Number on our way till Peppl will now respresent a possibility in the ranges of the Universe. From the entire Universe and just one Atom, Proton, Neutron in it, over the possibilitys that we call our life, to a Universe completly filled with Uran . A possibility where the Lord of the Rings Universe is real, but Saurons Eye is an Discoball and Peter Jackson is filming every scene with a Potato while beeing totaly serious.

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

And this is the World biggest Number and there is no Number past of it. You might say: There is: just add 1. But the World biggest Number contains you thinking exactly this at your moment, at your place, with your face on fire, just because it can.

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

We may never reach that Number. But we can add Parameters to a Calculation. Params like: Cubicle Size of the Universe. Mass of it. Amount of possible Atoms and so on. We may can substract things that are not possible, like a universe made fully out of Uran. But hey. Im did not study Physic or Chemistry, neither have I ever been good at it, despite my love for such Information. So that may be your part.

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

And this is where the discussion start. But first of all: Did someone else wrote something about this? I can not be the first one, its just to simple. And we dont have to discuss this before we read his/her work. This also might be Bullshit. I can live with the roast. But i cannot live without a proper discussion with someone who has a better understanding for such things.

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

I also may apologize for my Englishgrammar. There might be a possibility of a me who is a mothertongue, but not this one.

Physics,"The index of refraction for normal (pressure and temperature) air is 1.00029. Dividing the speed of light by this yields us 299,705,543.392 m/s as the speed of light in normal air. This means a light second in normal air is 299,705,543.392 m.

The refractive index of hot air is 1.00014 which gives us a speed of 299,750,492.931 m/s using the same processes. This gives us a light second in hot air as 299,750,492.931 m.

This gives us 3 numbers, a light second (299,792,458 m  
), a light second in air (299,705,543.392 m  
) and a light second in hot air (299,750,492.931 m

A hot second is the ratio of an air-light second to a normal light second, multiplied by the ratio of an air-light second to a normal light second. This gives us (299,705,543.392 m / 299,750,492.931 m) \* (299,705,543.392 m / 299,792,458 m

Physics,"Studying Special Relativity I’ve learned that the speed of light is the same if measure from every frame of reference: it always propagates at the speed c (in vacuum).

“This is analogous to the case of sound, the speed of sound waves being likewise independent of the motion of the source”

This may be trivial for someone, but it shocked me so much that I immediately came here to write this post.
Maybe it’s just that I’m misinterpreting something, but: if the speed of sound has this property, what was the matter with Michelson and Morley experiment?

Physics,"So this is going to be quite a long post and I apologize for that but I just want people to know where I am coming from.

I am an accounting major at a public university and have 3 semesters left to graduate. However I am going to need another 26 credits after I graduate to become eligible for the CPA exam (you need 150 credits). Now I hope this doesn't come off the wrong way but I am one of those people who honestly loves to learn. I know that sounds corny but it really is how I feel. Which can be annoying because you don't always have the time or resources to educate yourself in everything you're interested in. In my case that's economics/finance and sciences like physics. Sure I know the basics of economics because of my major and know a little more than the basics in finance but I still want to know more.

Also I do like my undergrad major I don't want anyone to get that idea from this post, I just want to learn more lol.

The only thing that is holding me back from taking the next step is the calculus. I was one of those people who thought that calculus was useless and ""whats the point of learning this"" until I actually started to realize the applications calculus has in literally all 3 subjects I am interested in lol (economics, finance, and physics). Then I actually gained a respect for it and thought it was really interesting. Ive only taking pre calculus and business statistics and applications in college.

If you're a fan of minecraft then you probably know about redstone and you might know about people making crazy things like calculators with it. Another feature of minecraft is its randomly generated world and the different biomes within it. Biomes are zones where certain terrain features are much more likely to occur than others like, deserts have sand, forests have trees, etc..  


What if there was a biome in minecraft that was rich with redstone circuitry, power sources and was generally level to facilitate connections? If you could generate million of these worlds rich with the redstone biome, would you ever be able to generate a natural calculator? I think you might be able to get something pretty crude eventually but there wouldn't be much of a point. Maybe instead of a calculator you could build some sort of naturally occuring sensor or signal to provide information back to whoever is running the simulations.   


Assuming that these structures are rare in all the the worlds you' have to generate, they would be invaluable pointers that could save tremendous amounts of resources looking at uneventful space.

Physics,"Below is an email I tried to send to Leonard Susskind. His talks have been a huge inspiration behind what I'm about to present. It has been approximately since 1 year and no response. I assume he no longer checks email. Below is an unedited paste from my copy.

In no way am I knowledgeable in this area at all. Really, this theory is more philosophical but I try really hard to ground it in reality based on theoretical physics ideas. **All I hope for is to sprout an interesting conversation among actual physicists.** Thank you!

-----

Hello Professor Susskind,

I'm unsure about the amount of time you allocate for emails; presumably not much. Given this assumption I'll do my best to express my theory briefly. I've watched your lectures online (YouTube) and they are truly inspirational. I'm writing this email because you seem to be one of the few people who would at least be entertained by the idea I'm going to present. I am not a physicist, but this does not stop me from studying as a hobbyist. I think Mathematics and Physics are amazing tools to discovering the limitations of everything around us.

I digress, the theory is simply: given finite number of states of the universe, reincarnation is inevitable.

In https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2DIl3Hfh9tY (The World As Hologram) and https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jhnKBKZvb_U (Why is Time a One-Way Street?) you present a few critical ideas for this:

1. Bits are indestructible.
2. Given enough time, particles will find themselves back in their origin position if bounced around a box.
3. The Universe is a hologram (particles on a surface, more particularly).

Let's go through the states of life and death:

I am alive now. My brain is composed of complex chemical reactions, and fed stimuli through various receptors. Maybe the matter at a cellular level is configured a certain way to create memories and the sense of self. We cannot know for sure at the moment, but we know that holding the state of a brain, a human brain in particular, we can more or less say we have captured the idea of self.

Now fast forward 60 years, and I pass. While unconscious, we do not perceive time. It is reasonable to continue thinking this is true while dead. Now our body's particles decay and scatter far and wide into the Universe (worst case scenario).

Then the magic happens. Given enough time, even something so absurd, such as the death and rebirth of the Universe thousands of times, our particles should eventually find their way back together. And for us, no time has passed at all.

There are some slight issues with this theory though, on the surface:

1. This means we must give up the idea of a soul or a transcendental body.
2. This counts on the Universe having finite states or
2.1. The Universe being cyclic to go through every state

That can be solved with the following:

1. Ok. I can accept there is no soul if it means we discover self is just a state of atoms.
2. From what I've read, it looks promising the Universe is cyclic. Given your talk about the world as a hologram, this theory also lends itself to the idea the Universe has finite states. Given a 2D plane filled with ""holographic pixels"", there're only so many configurations.

There is one final problem though. If our self is a sub-state of a larger state, surely we can exist (clones of the sub-state) in many places of the Universe? To this I say: no.

Let's use two computers as isolated test subjects. These computers are configured the exact same way: hardware is the exact same, they look the same, and their contained data is the exact same. If you were to observe them at an atomic level they are the exact same.

So what makes them different? If they were clones of brains, would they be the same person? Of course not, they are both having thoughts of their own, and with sensors they would be already receiving stimuli causing them to stray and become different people.

The only way to have them receive the same stimuli and cause the same thoughts is to occupy the same space. To occupy the same space is physically impossible. So we are at a contradiction. This means we cannot just clone a brain and retain self. There is something more to self that obviously we have yet to quantify. Regardless, this contradiction proves there is a unique state to each ""self"" that exists. No sub-state can be a true clone because it cannot occupy the same space.

I hope that was entertaining. I figured before writing this, that there's a good chance you've thought about this before. It would correspond with one of my own laws (Lee's law): If you've thought about it, someone else has probably done it.

Have a great day, I'm extremely excited for your response, good or bad!

Physics,"Okay, first of all, I'm really sorry for framing the title like this. I ""understand"" that the universe is ""expanding"", I've taken a course in general relativity and cosmology, and I get the mathematics and the experimental data supporting the expanding universe hypothesis.

But the whole thing just seems so counterintuitive to me, and I get a seizure when I try to explain it to someone who doesn't have a STEM background. 

Basically, I can't get explain the whole universe-is-expanding-nothing-business. Most popular recountings avoid this (while pretending to answer it)  by saying that it is the spacetime itself that is expanding. I don't find this too satisfactory. Since the physical distance between two objects increase due to the expansion of the universe, it must (says the layman) must be expanding into something. Moreover, shouldn't the objects themselves get stretched, argues a particularly well-informed layman, since it is a part of the fabric of spacetime, just like the primordial seeds (quantum fluctuations) were stretched to give rise to the large scale structures!

I personally feel it's a matter of semantics: the word ""expansion"" doesn't capture the physics of the situation which is essentially described by mathematics. If that's the case, what is a better to describe the so called expansion of the universe.",Is the universe really expanding?,1552393025

I am a high school student, and I am looking for some help in completing my physics assignment (a 15 page report). Basically, I am exploring the time period of a bar pendulum in response to the distance from the pivot point. I took a wooden ruler (100cm) and punched holes every 5cm. I then suspended the ruler from every point, and took measurements for the time period of oscillations. ([The apparatus sort of looked like this, except it was a wooden bar](https://5.imimg.com/data5/CM/YH/MY-2451704/simple-28pendulum-29-250x250.jpg)).

The observations revealed a parabolic graph, wherein as the distance from a point (which was the the centre of mass) increased, the time period decreased, then increased. [It looked similar to this](https://1.bp.blogspot.com/-gtF7ijrUt-s/Vk8FN0hKOdI/AAAAAAAABA8/jI2ruRf_h50/s1600/cpd4.jpg).

Now, I used some online papers to derive this equation:

*l**^(2)* \+ *lL* \+ *K**^(2)* = 0

... where '*l*' is the distance of point from center of mass, '*L*' is the total length of the pendulum, and '*K*' is the radius of gyration.

Physics,"Simulation software have important role in research and development of technology because simulation of a process provide some details for consideration of the process to design or improve. Nowadays, programming in other sciences has a very special place because the importance of computers cannot be ignored as a very effective application in technical and research affairs. Chemistry counts as key field between other sciences because chemistry is a diversified science and includes very subcategories and related major like electrochemistry, physical chemistry, analytical chemistry, pharmaceutical chemistry and etc.

In the today’s world, it’s axiomatic that the decreasing fuel sources, pollution and global warming are important problems. In addition to, the sun and wind as renewable energy sources are attracting more regard as alternative energy sources. Fuel cells are a beneficial energy technology that generates electric energy through the reaction between the fuel sources rich in hydrogen and oxygen. In comparison with combustion engines, fuel cells have many advantages, such as high efficiency and low emissions. Furthermore the by-products of fuel cells are heat and water. Proton exchange membrane fuel cells (PEMFCs) have attracted much interests recently. PEM fuel cells are Pollution-Free high-efficiency power sources for urban vehicles that recently corporate by legislative initiatives. The fundamental structure of a PEMFC can be described as two electrodes (anode and cathode) separated by a solid polymer membrane that acting as an electrolyte. The hydrogen gas is the Best fuel for fuel cell powered vehicles, because of the highest conversion efficiency for fuel, generating zero tail-pipe emission and producing water as an only product of the reaction between hydrogen and air.

The OPEM software (open proton exchange membrane) written in Python programming language that is very powerful and popular option for developers and also, is useful and accessible for scientists. Simulation models in PEMFC include dynamic and static models. Static models focus more on electrochemical techniques and can predict the performance of PEMFC. Simulated parametric models combined with the empirical approach that describes the important concepts such PEMFC polarization losses, efficiency, and Nernst voltage. Dynamic models improve static models and complete the simulation process. In dynamic models, the science of fluid and material merge with electrochemical principles and dynamic concepts. Consideration the rules of absorption and penetration of gases based on their pressure and density, causes the simulation of fuel cell to be more accurate and higher quality. In this software inputs are parameters that each users can specify according to the equations of each models. Outputs are in the three formats CSV, HTML,  
and OPEM. OPEM can be used online in interactive Jupyter Notebooks via the Binder service. Also, OPEM has Telegram Bot.

With all of these interpretations, modeling and simulation of proton-exchange membrane fuel cells (PEMFC) may work as a powerful tool in the research &amp; development of renewable energy sources. Thus, OPEM is a modeling tool for evaluating the performance of PEM fuel cells. This package is a combination of some models (static/dynamic) which are predicting the optimum operating parameters of PEMFC.

Physics,"I have recently purchased a book called ""fundamentals of physics"" by R. Shankar. I am using it to self study physics, and currently I am in the second chapter about 2d motion. More specifically about 2d motion in a circle path.
 
The position of the particle is:
r(t) = R(i•cos(wt) + j•sin(wt))
Where R is the radius, t is time, i and j are the unit vectors, and w (should be omega) is the angular velocity.

The derivative of r with respect to t is the velocity (which I understand) turns out to be :
v(t) = Rw(-i•sin(wt) + j•cos(wt))

Now the part I struggle with. According to the book, if we square the velocity we should get
v² = (wR)²(sin²(wt) + cos²(wt)) = (wR)²

Thus
v = wR
Which is a constant. But when we square (-i•sin(wt) + j•cos(wt))

Why isn't it:
v² = (Rw)²(sin²(wt) - 2sin(wt)cos(wt) + cos²(wt))

Physics,"Today while taking a dump in the toilet, I realised If you spray the toilet shower(the water should move rapidly) on the wall, the water molecules gain a large amount of kinetic energy during that small time interval of collision with the wall; Due to which the water forms small droplets and stays like that for a few seconds, after which some evaporate and some fall back. 

Now, if you keep your hand in the region where these water droplets are falling, if you have even a bit of hair on your hand, you will realise that when these water droplets fall onto the hair in our hands, they don't spread or move down, they form a droplet on your hand hair.

So, the angle of contact between water and hand hair is an obtuse angle and the surface tension in the hair-water interface is higher than the vector sum of surface  tensions of the hair-air interface and that of the air-water interface respectively. 

The reason why this effect is not observed when you pour a cup of water on your hand is that in this case, there are a large number of water molecules, thus there are a large number of collisions happening in between the water molecules to provide the water molecules enough energy to easily overcome the energy cost created by the surface tension in the water-hand hair interface.

For a water droplet, there are very few molecules, so the number of collisions between water molecules in a water droplet is very less, as a result, the water molecules do not gain enough kinetic/thermal energy to overcome the energy cost created by the surface tension in the hand hair-water interface. In contrary, the surface tension in the water-skin interface is very much lesser than the surface tension in the water-hair interface, this can be easily observed when even small droplets of water are able to spread onto our skin.

 So from my basic everyday physics knowledge/rumors I have learned these few possibilities about ouf great universe. These like facpinoons are.

• The universe was created via the 'Big Bang"" The way I heard this supposedly happened is that in the beginning. Before time itself, there was nothing. Just nothing, just an empty voidn of nothing ness. Bang. Something exploded out universe into existence, that nothingness was suddenly being fill rapidly in all directions with space. At the speed of light the universe was being filled. This is my first little factoid feom the internet. 
• Black holes. Ok so these bad boys happen when i star reached thee nd of it life. The star is so huge. This huge star is old and dies and implodes into itself So this massive celestial object, full of unamginable energy is imploding, condensing amd its xreating a gravitational pull unlike anything imaginable. At its end the pull is so strong irs forms a black hole. A section of space, or really lacl there of, is practically just pure gravity. Now everything remotely distanr is pulled into this black hole and seemingly vanishes into nothing. Beong pulled into literal non-existence.


my wackjob theory is that the objects/light/,,,(may even time idk?) being pull into the black hole isnt just being destroyed. What if, when If when a black hole is formed it actually a ""big bang"" the bang creating a new, altertinate universe and  while the new universe is being filled with new space/light/matter, the original universes black hole that is pulling in space/light/matter isnt destroying but sending it to the new universe that it created? Like the black is a portal to another universe and our universe expanding because its being fed matter from a black hole that spawned in a PRIOR universe and that cycled infinitly. 

And you might think ""before the black hole that creates this portal, what is there? How can it create a portal to 'nowhere' anyways""  well, it wouldn't be *nowhere"" precidely. Think of a hard drive for a computer. Before installation it has no data, its empty, there is literally nothing BUT you can ad to it.

So the ""before"" aspect to the big bang could be compared to a computers empty HD / SSD.

Physics,"I've always had a problem with a typical capacitor exercise that goes beyond the solution. So the exercise goes as follows:

Suppose you have two ideal capacitors, *C1,* that is charged so it has a voltage of *V0*, and *C2,* that is discharged. Calculate the resulting voltage across *C1* (or *C2*) after you connect them in parallel.

There are two principles one can follow when attempting to solve this exercise: 1. conservation of charges and 2. conservation of energy. Oddly enough, these methods don't yield the same result.

1. If the total amount of charges is conserved, both the total energy in the system and the resulting voltage decrease by a factor of *1 / (1+R)*, with *R = C1/C2*.
2. If the total energy is conserved, the resulting voltage yield a factor of *sqrt(1 / (1+R))* whereas the total amount of charges increases by a factor of *sqrt(1+R)*.

By some reason I don't know, method #1 is the correct one. I've always supposed that it's because in #2, charges appears out of thin air. I remember having read in a textbook that the remaining energy is dissipated or even radiated, to which follows my questions:

How can two ideal capacitors dissipate energy when I didn't introduce any non-ideal property to the system? Does that mean the model of the capacitor is a bad model? 

Moreover, if I accept that these two principles cannot work at the same time, shouldn't I trust more the energy conservation principle than the charge conservation principle? and claim that the universe pops charges in order to maintain the total amount of energy.

Physics,"Hi, I had some wonderful ideas while creating an Instagram post about time travel. I personally don't believe we can do it and I said why in this post, so let me know what you think!

You can look back in time by capturing light. Light carries information and because of that, if you look at an object that is for example 1 light year away from us, you will see what was going on 1 year ago, because the light is still travelling to your eyes and the information is still travelling along with it. Best example would be our Sun, it takes 8 minutes 20 seconds for light to travel from Sun to Earth so whenever we look at Sun, we see how it looked 8 minutes and 20 seconds ago.

Paradoxes don't allow time travel. You should be familiar with the grandfather paradox. You travel back in time before you parents were born, kill your grandfather, and because your parents were never born you also were never born so you cannot exist, so how did you travel back in time if you don't exist? 

Also, you're made out of atoms, you eat food that contains atoms and you absorb them into your body, if you travel back in time, those atoms you absorbed before the journey are now elsewhere, so you end up with 2 identical atoms and you multiply things, if time travel would be possible, we could easily multiply things with a low energy cost.

And if you could travel back in time, how do you know you would remember anything? Otherwise, travelling back in time would be useless, since you couldn't change anything, and it would also cause you to travel back in time every time when enough times passes until you come to a time point where you decided to travel back in time and you would continue to do that forever.

What if you could bring the whole universe back in time? Would there be 2 identical universes and it would continue to double and double forever and ever?","Time travel, read and decide if it's still possible",1550701511

The premise is if the voltage is strong enough and thus the current is strong enough the induced magnetic field by the coil will counteract the magnetic field of the magnet and cause the iron fillings to fall. 

What I need help with is, I don't know where to get the coil for my magnet.

Physics,"So basically, let's say I have an object with a known mass and heat capacity, all that good stuff. I apply energy at a constant rate to it, and want to calculate how long it'll take for the object to reach a certain temperature, keeping in mind that the object will lose the energy that I'm applying to it at a rate proportional to difference in temperature between it and its surroundings.  We can assume that the energy is applied more or less uniformly to the object. 

Granted my calculus skills are admittedly a bit rusty, but if we were to use newtons law of cooling, we have an equation relating energy flow to temperature as a function of time.  Basically net energy / time  = energy in (constant) - energy out (temp).  Except in this case temperature is also a function of heat flow.

Physics," 

Hello, I'm an IB student. My physics Internal Assesment (which is essentially a project requiring you to investigate a phenomenon from your syllabus by conducting individual research, the IA constitutes a set percentage of your final grade), is about investigating the effect of a Convex Lens' thickness on its focal length when the diameter is kept constant.

I could only manage to find 5 lenses with the same diameter. The results (after repeating the experiment thrice) indicate that the relationship is a negative linear proportion, with the equation ""y=-0.9078x+63.277"" where y is the focal length and x is the thickness of the lens.

However, when this data is compared to the lens makers equation, the equation suggests an inverse proportion. The derivation is as follows:

f= ((nR)/(n-1)\^2) x 1/t

hence; f (focal length) is inversely proportional to t (thickness).

It would be very helpful if I could get assistance on the issue by either being referred to the origins of the lens makers equation which I am otherwise unaware of, or by being referred to any relevant information. Not to sound cocky but I don't require the issue to be solved as help, since I want to do that myself, I only require assistance on the information.

Physics,"Hi, I am an engineering student from Germany, currently in the first semester. I just wrote my first exam in physics for engineers and lately I am having occasional thoughts on relativity.

My question for you:
We always assume the big bang as beginning of time, but isn't it more correct to say that the big bang is just the cause or beginning of entropy? 

Since, according to the theory of relativity, matter and energy are convertible into each other, if we regard the principle of conversation of energy, the total energy (or mass) of the universe is constant as it is the biggest inertial system we can think of. Please correct me at any point if I'm wrong.

So let's just assume that the theory is correct that the total amount of energy in the universe is constant. Means this energy is the same since (and probably even before) the big bang. This matters why? Cause we can assume that the laws of relativity need to apply universally now. 

We perceive time linear, assuming that there was a beginning, there obviously is a middle thing (we call it life I guess) and an end. On a human scale this would apply as birth (beginning), life (middle) and death (end) , and since we experience this linearity everywhere we assume that it works everywhere. My guess now: because time is relative, there is no beginning and end of time.

Let me explain.

Time universally is a dimension of our universe, such as space is. We cannot feel or touch it, but we can experience it through change, or I think the term more fitting is entropy. Therefore we assume it's linearity which we cannot prove. Confusingly, Albert Einstein famously ""messed with time"" and basically stated that time as well as mass and length (or on a more dimensional scale space) is relative. What does this mean? Time ""acts"" linear to the observants velocity. If you've read this so far and don't know what I am talking about, I recommend for you to research upon time dilation. It's quite interesting! Basically, if you look at the formula for time dilation, you'll see that there is a basic relation given. The faster you are, the slower you experience time, which results in the universe ""being faster"" than you. From your perspective, your relative velocity is zero while the universe moves around you, resulting in time out of your perspective passing faster around you than you experience it. 

A quick example: if you're falling into a black hole, the gravitational pull would accelerate you up to light speed, therefore the further you ""fall"" into it, the more time of the universe you perceive, up to the point where you reach light speed and see... Nothing. From a human point of view you're 1. Dead and 2. At the end of time. But you said there is no beginning and end of time?!? Yes. We just cannot perceive time in it's initial state. From an observants point of view who watches you while not moving relative to the black hole, you would accelerate to all eternity while never reaching light speed. You wouldn't be at the end of time, you would be AFTER the infinity of time. Which, in and of itself is a paradoxon. Hmmm, I guess I got myself into a corner now, so let's leave this example here and take it just for the thoughts we initially were Keen to get of.

Let's apply our relativity concept to the big bang. Well, what is the big bang EXACTLY? For all we know, there was energy. A huge amount of energy so to say. All of the universe is made of it, just to give you dimensions. There wasn't any space yet and time was an infinite state. Then, the energy reacted, and some of it was converted into matter and anti matter. Luckily for us, there was more matter than anti matter after the big bang, which I hopefully don't need to explain (quick reminder, you exist, which is proof enough). But what happened with time in that big bang? Well, it got measurable, cause space became a thing. If you think of it, the universe exploded into existence, so in the first ""moments"" after the big bang, so right after the reaction, time was incredibly fast and slowed down with the expansion resulting of the big bang. This is the result we can draw of the black hole thought experiment. The universe in it's first moments was so fast because its borders just became existent, like a balloon you blow up. And time with its expansion got slower and slower.

This thought experiment leads me to the conclusion that time in the pre big bang initial state of the universe is infinite, therefore there will never be a beginning nor an end of time in total, just a beginning and end of the observable time.

[Dark Energy Gets Weirder: Mysterious Force May Vary Over Time](https://www.space.com/43166-dark-energy-increasing-time-quasars.html)  
For  the second time in as many decades, the LCDM interpretation of photon  redshift as being related to (caused by) expansion has failed a second  major test of that concept.  The original big bang model predicted that  the universe should be slowing down and \*decelerating\* over time due to  gravity.   
SN1A  studies however demonstrated that prediction was incorrect if in fact  photon redshift is related to expansion rather than inelastic  scattering/tired light as Hubble himself suggested and preferred as an  explanation for redshift.  
To  'fix"" the failed prediction of the expansion interpretation of  redshift, astronomers made a dubious and problematic choice to violate  the conservation of energy laws by adding a new hypothetical form of  energy called ""dark energy"" to their model.  Dark energy violates the  conservation of energy laws of physics by remaining at a constant  density over multiple exponential increases in volume, thereby  constantly adding new energy to the overall system.  
Unfortunately  however, it turns out that distant quasars cannot be explained by ""dark  energy"" remaining at a constant density throughout the expansion  process.  Instead, dark energy would actually have to \*increase\* in  density over multiple exponential increases in volume to ""fix"" their  second major failed prediction in just the last two decades.  
Keep  in mind that Edwin Hubble did \*not\* prefer the expansion interpretation  of redshift. Instead he preferred a static universe and a ""tired  light""/inelastic scattering explanation for photon redshift of distant  objects in space.  He simply assumed that photons transferred some of  their momentum to the medium of spacetime.

Chen  has already demonstrated an empirical cause/effect link in the lab  between the number of free electrons that are present in a plasma and  the amount of redshift that is observed when passing photons through a  plasma medium.   There are empirically verified ways to explain photon  redshift without violating any known laws of physics and without  introducing any new and exotic forms of energy.  
Considering  that this is the second major predictive failure of the LCDM model of  expansion in just the last 20 years, it might be time that astronomers revisit  Hubble's preference for a tired light solution to the redshift  observation.  The expansion interpretation of redshift simply doesn't  seem to be particularly useful or correct at predicting observations at  higher redshifts.",Dark Energy Gets Weirder: Mysterious Force May Vary Over Time,1549943629

Physics,"Hi, 

I'm unqualified to answer a question I thought of while watching an educational video about construction of world wonders and how an as-of-yet unexplored empty space in one of the Gizan great pyramids was discovered with Muon Tomography. I also heard from an episode of PBS Nova that Muon Tomography was used at Fukushima and recently Chernobyl (I believe, around the time of the construction of the megatomb) to assess the state of the meltdowns without risking human life.

Muon Tomography is really fascinating, and I thought about it again while watching an educational video about surface pictures and scans of Pluto and Ultimate Thule.

It also seems as though you have to have muon detectors on both sides of the object? Correct me if I'm wrong.

My background is mostly in string compactification, and a well-known method (GKP, 2002) for generating physical hierarchies relies on warped compactifications making use of the Randall-Sundrum mechanism. In the traditional Randall-Sundrum model, the extra dimensions are non-compact, and the hierarchy depends on factors like brane tension, separation, etc. As I have little to no knowledge of the experimental results from modern gravitational wave astronomy, I am wondering if anyone can give a concise description of the constraints put on Randall-Sundrum braneworld scenarios by modern experimental methods. My impression from the literature is that bounds exist but are not stringent enough to remove the possibility of a non-compact extra dimension, but recent popular articles seem to contest this (cf.

I was stoned and watching youtube and I came to this thought



If it is a possibility that the universe ends by dark matter losing its energy ;halting the expansion of the universe and gravity pulling everything back to a big bang density. Would it be possible that this would be like a black hole on crack?

I've heard it theorized (not entirely sure where and I could be making it up but I'm pretty sure I heard or read it).  That the forces in the center of a black hole will literally tear apart the fabric of space time opening a hole to a new dimension of space time.

If the big crunch could create a black hole out of all the matter in the universe, the force of all of that compression could then blast through space time popping out on the other end of that singularity, into what would essentially be a new reality. Shooting all that matter out into the new reality. Almost like our universe has just been slingshotting itself through dimensions.

Physics,"Hello all, I'm new to studying physics and I'm a little bit stumped on one of the examples that Sal Provides on Khan Academy. I understand Net Force to be equal to mass times acceleration. Within the provided picture, that would make the net force of X 6N. Yet, the tension of the rope is given as 12N.   


This leads me to believe(likely fallaciously) that the tension of the rope is the Net Force times two.  


I'm really searching for an explanation on why Sal set the tension of X equal to the net force. Especially when (I believe) the net force can be solved for right off the bat because the acceleration and mass is already given.   


I understand that the cos(60) = Tension^(x)/Tension; but it seems like Sal is saying that Tension^(x) = Net Force X. This does make sense considering the acceleration is constant, and the theoretical table has no friction. But that doesn't explain why Net Force = Mass \* Acceleration gives a different result than cos(60)\*Tension = Tension^(x) . I understand the results mathematically, but not conceptually I suppose; As previously mentioned my first reaction was to just solve for the net force by multiplying mass and acceleration.

First, I am going to make a couple necessart comstraints for the argument:

&gt;if you travel back in time you are also able to travel to where earth was in the universe at that time 


&gt;if you travel back in time, into space occupied by air or other matter, you will displace it unproblematically (A big assumption but a constraint necessary for the argument) 

The atoms that make up your body or at least the subatomic partials, would still exist back in that past time. All these particles in your body would be duplicates of their past selves that are (in the time you have traveled to) spread throughout space, not necessarily even near each other at all. 

Would this duplication of matter not cause an issue? 

My gut reaction is that you are essentially creating new matter, breaking the law of conservation of mass.   But I feel a natural counter argument would be that you are merely moving matter along the axis of time. But that doesn’t really seem like a satisfying counter argument. Perhaps I just don’t have the education to wrap my head around the problem fully. ",A thought on matter and time travel,1549367617
Physics,"In my modern class we did a thought exparament where you picture yourself in a ""stationary"" frame of refrence and a charged particle zooms past you.  We know that a changing electric field will induce a magnetic field.  Therefore, the changing electric field caused by the particle will induce a magnetic field on you.

However, we also know that if something is moving in your reference frame, you are moving in its.  To be clearer, the particle could be ""stationary"" and you zoom past it and the same result will be observed. A changing electric field and therefore a magnetic field.

This begs the question, what if you and the particle were traveling in parallel (side by side and at the same velocity)?  Well, the electric field is no longer changing and therefore no magnetic field is observed.

A current is just moving charges.  So if we replace the word ""partical"" with ""current"" and run though the exparament again, what happens?  Based on the above, if you are moving parallel to a current and at the same velocity, than No.  No magnetic field is felt.

So again I ask, if you were moving at the same ""velocity"" and in the same direction as an electric current would you feel a magnetic field?  Is energy conserved by observing a stronger electric field when both of you are in parrell rather than a magnetic field and an electric field when one is moving faster?

[Normal color vision vs Inverted color vision](https://i.redd.it/ypnvmkcm9md21.png)

Inverted color vision is a theoretically possible eye condition where the colors in the rainbow are inverted which means that the violet the longest wavelength and lowest frequency while the red shortest wavelength and highest frequency.  


The perception of color with this condition is not negative but rather the colors are inverted in the spectrum. This means that they're still normal as they still follow the brightness and can see bright as bright and dark as dark.  


They can perceive the sun as cyan, the sky as red, the oceans as red, sunrises and sunsets as blue, brown as cobalt, blood as blue, etc. The blackbody radiation is also inverted; coldest fire/lava/star which is red, orange, and yellow is blue, azure, and cyan, while the hottest fire/lava/star which is blue, bluish-white, and white is red, reddish-white, and white.

I, for one, think that this is possible. My concern isn't the viability of this, but rather the level to which the self-teaching should go. I'd say the guide should cover freshman physics, which would give the learner a head start, should he choose to pursue physics.

For a bimolecular compound such as O2,  this is instead 5/2KT.

Recently I have been going through the top submissions on r/askscience and I stumbled upon [this](https://www.reddit.com/r/askscience/comments/ahyapf/if_we_could_travel_at_999_the_speed_of_light_it/) thread. Upon reading the top comment(which most of the time is the correct answer to the question) I find myself disagreeing with it. The question is basically, does the travel for the passengers of a near-light speed spaceship feel normal, or does the passage of time feel faster? The top answer was yes, it feels shorter by the gamma factor. Here's my disagreement with it:no, it does not. Here is my reasoning: The lorenz transforms from stacionary frame of reference to a moving one do indeed have the neccesary consequences of special relativity - the time dillation and length contraction etc. But these are all experienced by observers from a stationary(read - not a comoving) frame of reference - a person would see our ship as a bit smaller than it was measured to be on earth and the clocks on that ship would seem to run faster. But we ""feel"" with our body clocks, our metabolism and our aging mechanisms all of which are moving together with the ship in near-light speed so, the only way we would be able to tell that we were traveling at near-light speed was if we looked at a stationary clock (or at a clock that is not moving with us in our frame of reference) and the time of that clock would tell a different time than the one on our ship.

For example's sake, lets say we're moving [.0338 grams of gold (~$1 worth)](http://www.goldcalc.com/scrap_gold_value.php) 1.5 km up a straight shaft vertically [out of the deepest reaches of the Obuasi Gold Mine,](http://www.mining.com/web/worlds-top-10-gold-deposits/)* then to Fort Knox, [a distance of ~9000 km as the bird flies](https://www.nhc.noaa.gov/gccalc.shtml). 

I doubt you move gold to fort knox before it's 'on the market' but i'm curious about the approximate order of magnitude of the movement energy cost here.

For the horizontal transport lets use semi truck efficiency: semis can move [19050900 g \(42000 lbs\)](http://www.xtl.com/much-freight-fits-full-truckload/) at [6.437 km/gallon \(4 mpg\)](https://www.commerceexpressinc.com/news/view/5-quick-facts-about-semi-trucks), and [a low-end gallon of diesel fuel contains 135.8 megajoules \(135800 kJ\)](https://www.extension.iastate.edu/agdm/wholefarm/pdf/c6-87.pdf).

So, r/Physics, What's the energy cost, in kilojoules, of moving .0338 grams of gold vertically 1.5 km and horizontally 9000km, with the horizontal movement efficiency assumed equal to low-end semi truck efficiency (which can move ~19050900 g a distance of ~6.437km / gallon, and diesel is roughly ~135800kJ/gallon) and the vertical movement efficiency only considering the force necessary to overcome gravity?

Physics,"Clarification: I'm a physicist and having a little trouble figuring out how a mix of vapours interact to get a humidity measurement.

Long explanation:

I want to calculate a humidity for a liquid vapour in the air and calculate/measure all the associated variables with that such as Dewpoint, absolute humidity, specific Volume and the Pressure and Temperature dependacies of this.

From what Ive found already, humidity mostly relates to water vapour. But one thing I have noted is that an added vapour into a gas doesn't effect other vapours. I.e. Vapour saturations are mutually exclusive.

So, if I take a humidity measurement in 'normal' air (has some RH already) with added vapour of a different vapour. How will that effect the humidity measurement compared to 'dry' air (0% humidity) with added vapour.

Let me explain my system a little fuller.

Imagine a e-cigerette device. It pulls 'normal' atmospheric air into the device. E-liquid vapour is vapourised in the device and mixes with the air. Now the air cools with the vapour in it causing condesation and liquid droplets to form.

As the air cools, the absolute humidity stays the same. However the relative humidity increases. Once it reaches 100%, then the air can no longer hold any more vapour so any further cooling causes the vapour to condense.

I want to be able to describe this system fully and know, for a given temperature and pressure: how much e-liquid vapour it can hold and what the humidity is/ all those associated variables.

Final remark: I will try to edit this as time goes on to better explain my system/ edit when I get on a computer.

So I had a series of thoughts and arrived at what seemed like interesting questions that maybe we humans already have an answer to. So entropy is a big thing in the universe right? Atoms abide entropy right? So... the only thing keeping atoms from reacting with one another is the distance apart right? Get to close and atoms have a chemical reaction in order to achieve entropy. So I was thinking, if you took all the atoms of our universe and confined them so that they would all have to interact with one another, how would that play out? Potentially different from the big bang because we don't have the atoms of all the other universes, but I'm curious what would be happening on a atomic level if one were to slow it down to analyze. Maybe having everything be too close would just cause an explosion or some volatile reaction so maybe that isn't what I want to ask. Let's say our universe began shrinking, how would atoms behave? I guess what I'm wondering is... do have atoms have a sort of lowest common denominator? I know atoms gain and lose electrons to change atomic structure, but what if atoms were smashed against each other. Would it become some atomic anomaly of something with too many electrons?

Physics,"So the usual visual analogy that everyone uses to show how gravitational waves work is done by stretching an elastic sheet of some sort over a circular stand. Then by placing objects with different weights on the sheet you can observe the sheet stretch due to the weight of the object. This is similar to how we think space is distorted around objects with a lot of mass.  
I think this is a great way to get someone to be able to start to understand how gravity works. The only problem is this is using a 2 dimensional sheet and we are distorting it in the 3rd dimension.  Where space is a 3 dimensional plane and gravity distorts it in some other way. 
I was listening to the Daniel and Jorge Explain the Universe podcast about gravitational waves. It pointed out that when mass creates gravitational waves it does not actually change the fabric of space in one of the three dimensions instead it alters an intrinsic property within space itself and a wave is generated that then effects everything with mass around it. 
So to better understand gravitational waves could we use the analogy of objects under water.  When you place an object with large volume and density it sinks and displaces the water that was originally there. Because this object displaces water the water level rises and the pressure on all objects within that same pool of water is increased. 
I know that pressure and gravity are not the same, but is this analogy correct in the fact that due to a large object being present under the water the water level rising would be unmeasurable if you were far away from the surface on some other smaller object and because of this change which you don’t fully understand a measurable change is created within that pool.
I imagine this being similar to how even though we don’t understand exactly what objects are doing to the fabric of space around them somehow they are creating an effect on all objects with mass around them.  We can measure this change but are not 100% sure how it is achieved. 
I would love feedback on this analogy. Also everyone should check that podcast out if they haven’t yet. Here is the link to the specific podcast about gravitational waves.

However, I thought it was an interesting topic that people might be curious about and since I put some effort into writing my response, I figured I'd just repost it here in case anyone finds it useful or someone wants to take issue with how I phrase this. 

&gt; Good question!

&gt; It turns out in fact that the statistical mechanics of many quantum mechanical particles is in fact a quantum field theory.
If one looks at the formalism of quantum field theory, it comes down to assuming that there is a quantum degree of freedom at every point in space-time. When you try and work out the mechanics of such a system, you get QFT.

&gt; Likewise, if you imagine say the statistical mechanics of a crystal, you have a molecule at each site on a lattice. If you only care about the low energy excitations in this lattice, then it turns out the lattice spacing is usually not relevant and you can more or less treat the crystal as continuous (lattice spacing goes to zero). One is then left with a quantum degree of freedom everywhere in the spacetime occupied by the lattice and the formalism of statistical mechanics becomes the formalism of quantum field theory!

&gt; This is why many modern condensed matter theories say that what they do is like high energy physics, except high energy theorists are stuck with just the one universe whereas every different material in condensed matter can have a different effective quantum field theory and so its like every different material is its own little universe with its own ‘fundamental fields and particles’.

&gt; This leads to a great variety of interesting QFTs to study and many cool ideas from high energy physics that haven’t been observed yet such as Supersymmetry, Majorana fermions, anyons, Chern Simons fields, magnetic monopoles etc. are all found in various condensed matter descriptions of materials!

I have done some experiments with a basic muon detector a while ago (based on the [CosmicWatch](http://cosmicwatch.lns.mit.edu/about) design). Unfortunately, my detector only used 8 scintillators and couldn't be tested extensively so I wasn't able to map their trajectory. I know that atmospheric muons are secondary cosmic rays and that they are unstable, so if I had been able to map it I should have observed a bigger flux coming from straight over the detector since that correspond to the muons that have spent the shortest amount of time in the atmosphere so must of them have not disintegrated in other particles yet.   


Now, imagine if I had a lot more scintillators and was able to distinguish muons from electrons and to determine their trajectory. Imagine I had not one but a bunch of these detectors and I was able to create a network of them, disseminated around the globe (yes I am super rich in this thought experiment). Usually, when people talk about the muon flux, they do as if it were perfectly isotropic and homogeneous and neglect completely the source of the energetic events that have led to their creation (because there are enough, equally distributed events like these I gues). Is this a correct assumption ? Or, if I had the previously mentioned network, would I be able to determine the origin of a bunch of muons detected on the different detectors simultaneously, by tracing them back to an unique point ? I couldn't really find anything about this, and it looks like muons are just assumed to be there for whatever reason and their exact origin is often completely swept under the carpet.

Physics,"When we fire an electron through two slits onto a detective screen, why do we never see two dots appear at once? 

The decoherence/many worlds explanation seems to be that we can write the incoming wavefunction as a sum of Delta functions, each of which evolves according to the SE and becomes roughly orthogonal to the others through its interaction with the screen. So the overall wavefunction of the system can be written as the sum of a bunch of orthogonal components corresponding to a spot being produced at a certain position on the screen - only one spot per orthogonal component.

However you can probably tell from my attempted explanation that I don't really understand this yet. In particular, I'm struggling to see why two spots couldn't simultaneously be produced as part of the interaction according to the SE, and then this solution keeps evolving, orthogonal to the rest.

Physics,"Methodology:

From Wikipedia's little chart on luminosity and star types, I made up my own chart. I computed the number of stars and the average luminosity of each star. Assuming there are 200 billion stars in the galaxy, I computed that the light from them should be about 330 million sun equivalents. If that's true, then the distance they must be from the earth to shed the same amount of light on earth would be sqrt(330B)AU. That’s 54800 AUs or about 8.5 light years. 

The stars could be placed in a ring, or a sphere, or concentrated in a single source. 

There’s no purpose in doing this calculation that I know of. Even so, if you have recommendations on how to improve it, I’d love to hear them.

An interesting intermediate result is that the average Milky Way star is about 1.5 times as bright as our sun.

Using 200 billion as galaxy population of stars is toward the low end of recent estimates. But that number is derived (as best I understand it) from the calculated mass of the galaxy which must include black holes. They, according to my understanding, are like 200W equivalent fluorescents. You can get to an amended final answer easily. For example, if you think 400B stars is more accurate, then the distance is (8.5 LY)\*sqrt(400/200) = 12.2 LY.

Below are the places I know error must’ve slipped in. If you see a glaring hole, feel free to provide gut insight on how badly my final number is skewed by it. 

I’m only dealing with main sequence stars. I have no idea which direction including the others  would take my answer, nor any sense of the magnitude of the change. Similarly, I don’t deal with black holes.

I’ve used 10\^6 rather than 10\^7 (See Pistol Star) for the upper range of luminosity in type O  Stars. Using the higher number results in these stars contributing 10% of galactic luminosity and pushes my solution back to 9 light years. 

I have not taken into account any measure of radiation other than Luminosity as provided by Wikipedia. I remain blissfully ignorant about how that number is computed. I’m immune to all concerns regarding the wavelength of stuff.

Physics,"My textbook's definition for equivalence of two electrical networks:

""Two networks are said to be equivalent at a pair of terminals if the voltage current relationships for the two networks are identical at these terminals.""

For example- equivalent resistance in linear circuits.

What I don't understand is how by that definition, given any circuit, I could replace any network of that circuit at a pair of terminals by an equivalent network, and there wouldn't be any ""difference"": the solution of the circuit would stay the same.

Now, what would happen if the outer edge of the sphere produced a completely uniform wave in the field, which radiated in towards the exact center causing a concentric wave spike? It can't go upwards like in the link to the video above. so what would it do?

Physics,"Sorry new to physics and had a question. I'm under the assumption that if we are on Earth looking at a planet that is 50 million light years away then we are essentially seeing what that planet looked like 50 million years ago, correct? So if the roles were reversed, they could look at our planet today but what they would see would be the dinosaurs roaming the earth, not the modern Earth we know? Hopefully thats right or else the next part doesn't matter.

Assume the planet above (not Earth) has teleportation capabilities. They would look at Earth, see the dinosaurs and then decide to go see them but when they instantly teleport from their planet to ours, they arrive at modern day Earth right? Doesn't this mean that when we go looking for ""aliens"" or anything else out in the vast universe, that we're kind of wasting our time if the planet isn't close enough? We're looking so far into the past that we wouldn't see what that planet has become, only what it was tens of millions of years ago. If you go back on Earth even as little as 10,000 years ago its not even close to the same planet. Which is probably why we havent found anything anywhere?

Now that I've put this all on paper I have one more question. Does this mean that (at least in our lifetime) the only way we'll be able to confirm life anywhere outside of Earth is if they come find us? It seems impossible that we would find life somewhere thats so far in the past that they haven't yet found a way to communicate with us right?

* Even if we find out that 'our' laws of nature were just a statistical fluke out of an infinite set of possible laws of nature (some sort of multiverse theory), the same question persists about the multiverse.

Physics,"Hello my physicist friends. I would like to pick your brains a little bit this afternoon. 

I just finished reading Erwin Schrödinger's late lectures on Mind and Matter and I could not help but notice the subtle leanings towards mysticism inflected throughout. I did some reading up on mysticism in physics and it turns out that Heinsberg, Bohr, and Pauli (to some degree) all were sympathetic towards the notion of incorporating mysticism in quantum mechanics. In fact, mysticism inspired some of their more important findings. Though, Einstein, a realist, was vehemently opposed to this incorporation. 

Today the field is essentially devoid of the debate of mysticism's place in quantum theory. However, I wonder if it is worth bringing back? Physicists in our generation cringe at notions of quantum consciousness and other theories bridging mysticism to physics. I understand the concern with propagating any notion of pseudoscience, but if these ideas were those at inspired some of the greatest strides in theoretical physics in the past decade, why the complete urge to dispel them from the field entirely? 

 It seems contradictory to me to disregard mysticism whilst placing the theories inspired by it on pedestal. Additionally, some academics and a vast amount of historians argue that understanding the underlying inspirations is essential to understanding quantum theory as a whole.. and if we do not strive to fully understand the theory completely, how can we possibly expect to progress it? Lastly, these were some of the most intelligent scientists of our time.. how can we not pay attention to their later reflections on their desired trajectory of the field that they revolutionized?

Physics,"To  cut a long story short, a cheap 30W CO2 'hobbyist'/light industrial infrared laser cannot etch stainless steel directly, but if you put 'certain' compounds atop the steel before etching through it, you end up with a deep, textured mark on the surface of the steel. See [https://www.evilmadscientist.com/2013/laser-moly/](https://www.evilmadscientist.com/2013/laser-moly/) for more information and pretty pictures [(or click here for example etching alone)](https://www.flickr.com/photos/oskay/9495824305/).

The commonly used method is spraying 'dry lubricant', AKA molybdenum disulphide, and the general belief is that it sinters the moly into the  steel. However, I recently learnt that plaster of paris, eg calcium sulphate also works - which leads me to wonder, is it actually sintering at all?  Or is the heat (\~1300 C) causing some other change, maybe chromium to chromium sulphate, and if so what else might achieve similar results? [(Example of results through plaster)](http://1.bp.blogspot.com/-UjBf_sM_vhU/VJnQ6jNAgHI/AAAAAAAAzMI/ZK7y7ElErEo/s1600/DSC_3971.JPG)

There is a limitation in that chlorine compounds cannot be used, the vapours  from those damage the machinery and lens. Doubtless that's not the only caveat, I suspect fluorine would do very similar for example! I'd rather not find out though. I doubt a cheaper alternative than calcium sulphate would arise, but maybe by understanding the process, better ones might be found? If it is altering the chromium then I'd be deeply  interested in the possibilities, as some of the compounds can be quite colourful.

&gt;“...redshifts,  by  increasing  wavelengths,  must  reduce  the  energy  in  the  quanta.  Any  plausible 
interpretation of redshifts must account for the loss of energy.”

In basic terms: Say a random space photon collides with a high-mass object, and is thus blueshifted while passing into its gravitational field. That blue(er) photon is *just* blue enough to cause an electron transition it otherwise would be too red to cause. In the end, that photon is going to add a tiny amount of excess mass-energy to the object that it didn't have whilst passing through space. Right? Where did that extra energy come from?

I think this is the inverse of the normal example given (redshift due to expansion of space).

Physics,"If we consider the plain language definition of coherence from Wikipedia, ""two wave sources are perfectly coherent if they have a constant phase difference and the same frequency, and the same waveform."" Now let's consider the magnitude squared coherence derived from the cross-spectrum. The cross-spectrum is derived from the Fourier transform, so we are using sine and cosine waves as basis functions. Our signals are thus modeled as sums of sine and cosine waves, so at each frequency, we are considering waves of the same waveform (i.e., sinusoids). 

Now, my question: if we have two sinusoids of the same frequency, how could they ever \*not\* have a constant phase difference? Two sinusoids of the same frequency must always share a constant phase relationship, otherwise the frequency of one of them has changed in order for the phase relation to change.

Physics,"( im an electrician so didnt studdy this deep into atoms / electronics ect so i thought id ask someone who does?

&amp;#x200B;

i was just being curious at work and asked a question to a work mate,

i was wondering when something isn't plugged into the power socket is their power at the socket or does the power only come to the socket once a load is plugged in....

&amp;#x200B;

it got very heated with such such words as potential volts and OHMs law even came out into play ( it never does in the feild ) someone above us does all the selection.

&amp;#x200B;

anyway 

&amp;#x200B;

the guy at work is going back to the old power is like water in pipes,

once the pipe is open ie you turn on your toaster ect the water starts flowing.....

but i cant see this happening with power,

i have been told im wrong by two people already but they are just electricians and dont understand what im saying,

&amp;#x200B;

so what i was trying to tell them, if the cord going down the wall was plugged into the socket  ( with nothing plugged in ) was in parallel to another socket with a toaster plugged in and in use,

im thinking all the energy is going straight to the path of least resistance ie the toaster as the socket has only air as the resistance which is very high especially as we are talking about 240v say 16a max breaker on the circuit,

&amp;#x200B;

anyways,

im thinking all the power is flowing to the load and not down the cable with no load as it will travel to were it is needed, but since the speed of electricity charging the atoms/ electrons is almost the speed of light the power is at the socket with no load as soon as you need load,

&amp;#x200B;

but they are saying no they are sitting at the unused load waiting to be used,

like a pipe full of water with the tap off 

&amp;#x200B;

but im thinking no its going past the unused cable because the charged electrons job is to go find uncharged electrons (neutral wire? ) until it finds another path of small enough resistance to make the electricity pass through positive to neutral, i don't see these atoms/electrons (sorry dont know what one is it ) wasting their time being positively be charged just waiting at the socket when there is another path it could go and be where it wants to be,

&amp;#x200B;

this is WAAAAAAAAAAAYYYYYY out of my scope of works and all they tell us at school is water acts like water and i think they may say this so its easier to understand 

but if you get down to the electron level of this subject 

&amp;#x200B;

what is the answer 

&amp;#x200B;

does voltage exist at the powerpoint with no load

or is it only their only once needed and its so fast you couldn't tell the difference

Physics,"I live in Taiwan. Today, I stumbled across [this](https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/3553499) local Taiwan News opinion piece published by Andy Chang, a retired geophysicist. I should point out I don’t know Andy, but evidently he has a BS degree from Cheng Kung University in Taiwan, an MS degree from the University of Missouri at Rolla and a Ph.D. from Rice University. Andy reportedly worked for DARPA’s nuclear explosion monitoring program using the Large Aperture Seismic Array (LASA) and the Norwegian Seismic Array (NORSAR). He had also worked for the Navy’s (which one?) acoustic research program. He can be reached at [bunsho2@gmail.com](mailto:bunsho2@gmail.com)

Historically, there is extensive documented evidence of terrestrial geomagnetic reversal events. Giving Andy the benefit of doubt, I’m curious if anybody else has witnessed any recent anomalies… and your impressions of his observations. I don’t claim to know one way or the other; just curious what you might think.

Here is Andy’s article, published Oct 16 on [taiwantimes.com.tw](http://taiwantimes.com.tw/) 

“I have been taking walks at the same time every morning for more than six years. I get up at 6:30 AM, wash my face, check my emails, and begin my daily walk around 7:20.  At this time, the sun is rising from the Eastern ridgeline. Oftentimes, I will use my iPhone to check the position of the sun.

At the spring and autumn equinox the sun will rise from N90°E.  After the spring equinox, the sun will gradually move north until it reaches N65°E on the summer solstice. Likewise, the sun will move southwards in the fall and reach N115°E on the winter solstice. The sunlight hours are 12 hours for spring and autumn equinox.  Daylight hours become longer in the summer and shorter in the winter.

However, a few days ago (October 7, 2018) when I checked my compass, I was surprised to notice the position of the sun in the compass indicated N82°E, and the true east (E) of the compass was located at the right side (southside) of the sun. I checked it again with the second compass app in my iPhone, but it was not a mistake.  This means either the rotational axis of the earth, or the magnetic pole of the earth had shifted.

After returning home from my walk, I put the iPhone on the table and aimed it to the power line tower located about a mile away from my house. Through my repeated observations with my iPhone compass, I know this tower is located exactly at the south of my house.  The sun will move but the tower will not move.  When the iPhone was aimed at the power line tower, the compass reading was N172°S.  This confirmed magnetic south (S) had moved westward about 8 degrees.

This is a major discovery.

We know the rotational axis of the earth and the NS pole of the magnetic field are different. We also know, when a large earthquake occurs, the earth’s rotational axis will sway. In about 1983 an Indian seismologist who taught at the Toronto University in Canada (a friend of mine, but I've forgotten his name) published a paper that showed the earth's rotational axis will sway after a big quake.

I remembered that the rising sun's position was N90E two weeks ago on the Autumnal Equinox Day (September 22).  This means the axis shift had occurred in between September 22 and October 7.  During this two-week period a large magnitude 7.5 earthquake occurred at offshore Indonesia on September 28.  So, although nobody noticed it, I believe that the axis shift of the Earth was caused by the magnitude 7.5 Indonesian earthquake on September 28th.

I am a retired seismologist for more than 20 years, so I have no way to publish this discovery at a professional conference. But, I can claim this discovery in my blog and hope other seismologists will follow up to investigate it.

There are some other problems.  I understood the axis of the earth moved due to a major earthquake, but the Indian professor in Toronto showed ""the earth’s axis swayed after a major earthquake.""  Was it the earth’s rotational axis, or the earth's magnetic pole that shifted?

The shift confirmed with a compass does not confirm whether it was the earth’s rotational axis or the magnetic axis.  Or, maybe both axes shifted.  How can we check this?

There is one way to check it.

The earth is a star moving around the sun. But, even if one or both of the axes moved, it would not change the relative position of the other stars in the sky.  By checking the positions of constellations or planets at a regular time, movement of the earth’s rotational axis could be confirmed.

I have a habit of going to bed at a fixed time and also do some simple exercise before going to bed. I also observe several stars from the bedroom window. I see Mars in the southwest sky, and at the west of it is another star I believe to be Jupiter. I checked the positions of these two stars and confirmed their positions did not change from about a month ago. Although it is a rough estimate, I believe the earth’s rotational axis of earth did not move, and the earth’s magnetic axis shifted instead.

Then I came up with another method to check.

It is to check the position of the TV satellite instead of stars. Nowadays many households receive TV signals from the TV satellite by using a dish antenna attached to the roof.  The dish antenna is aimed at a geostationary TV satellite located at N180°S and approximately 35,786 kilometers from the earth.  If the earth’s rotational axis had shifted from N180°S to N172°S, the aim of the dish antenna will shift together with the earth, and the TV reception will be affected. During these days I notice there was no television reception problems. This indicated that the Indonesian earthquake did not cause the earth’s rotational axis to shift but the magnetic axis had shifted.  I would be very happy if some geophysicists would check this discovery.”",Opinion: The Earth's magnetic pole has shifted,1539691860

I have two main questions:

1) Do I, as a future computer scientist, have any chance of working in a physics-related field and contribute to experiments, beyond, of course, analyzing data? (of course, a lot of physics is related to data-analysis, but you know what I mean, I think)

2) Do you recommend learning physics by myself? If so, where should I start? Classical mechanics?

* I assume gravity plays a role (thinking of Saturn's hexagonal storm).

The way I have heard t-symmetry explained is that physics work the same moving forward and backward in time. This is obviously not the case since anyone can tell you that things happen very differently moving backwards. So I thought that perhaps t-symmetry simply meant that things always happen the same(except in reverse) when time is reversed. But that can't be the case either since there is no way to test time moving backwards and thus no way to know if something would work differently.

As most here are aware, if you construct a sphere composed of hexagonal magnetic plates aligned such that the north side always points towards the interior, and the south side always points to the exterior, the magnetic flux lines interfere with each other, cancel out and the result is a non-magnetic chamber. 

But what if the magnetic fields were isolated?

New construction: A sphere constructed from steel. Hexagonal holes are punched into the steel frame, and each hexagonal mounting bracket is lined with a 1/4 cm of Mumetal. The Mumetal extends below the magnet to the interior of the sphere. The goal here is to create an interior where the magnetic flux lines are isolated inside the Mumetal, and do not escape to interfere with each other. Then, the hexagonal magnets are mounted and bolted in. The steel construction is for added strength, and because steel can carry more flux than mumetal, but isn't as good at conducting it as mumetal is.

Does the resulting sphere have properties of a monopolar magnet, and does anyone know of an attempted construction in this specific format with mumetal isolation? If such a sphere has not been constructed, and anyone has the tools to assist in the creation of such a sphere, I will donate up to $500 for its creation, and if you are in my area, I would show up to physically assist in the creation of it, and the testing of its properties.

So Einstein through his theory of special relativity and how the speed of light is constant to all observers in regardless of the frame of reference clarified the principle of simultaneous events where two events that are seen to be simultaneous in one frame of reference may not be in a different frame of reference.

Physics,"I chatted with one of my physics professors for roughly an hour today and he tried to tell me that quantum is weird, and I'm getting the feeling that everyone thinks that, but I don't think it's that bad? I mean, I've just been understanding everything as probabilities, and it has worked so far... Why are people so obsessed over the wave-particle duality? My understanding is that these aren't waves or particles, just waves of probability, and they become particles as soon as you measure them.

&amp;#x200B;

Anyways, so to show me how weird it can get (I think it was an attempt to prove his point) my physics professor told me about the delayed choice quantum eraser. (I have read the previous posts about this, and none seem to really offer up an explanation. I might have just missed something though.) I haven't read the paper yet so let me explain the experiment (to verify that I'm understanding it correctly and as a crash course to people that don't know about it):

[Delayed Choice Quantum Eraser block diagram](https://i.redd.it/ck7sgs0ls2q11.png)

This is the simplest block diagram that I can come up with to explain my understanding of the experiment... There is a photon source which produces a pair of entangled photons, γ1 and γ2. The detector on the left can move in the vertical direction y and so we can measure where γ1 is. For γ2, there are 4 detectors and 4 beam-splitters. The path γ2 takes is through the 4 beam-splitters, and at each beam-splitter it can be reflected or transmitted with a 50/50 probability. Therefore, A, B, C, and D have 25% chance of detecting γ2 each. (Ignore the fact that with this setup B would detect absolutely nothing, because wave interference...) The optical path from the first beam splitter to the 4 detectors A, B, C, and D are the same.

&amp;#x200B;

What my professor claimed is that if γ2 is detected at B or C then it acted ""like a wave"", since you don't know which path it took, and this is where the ""quantum erasing"" is. And if γ2 is detected at A or D then it acted ""like a particle"", since you know exactly which path it took. And, he said, what makes it weird is that depending on if γ2 acted like a particle or a wave, the pattern produced by the γ1 detector would be different, even though γ1 is detected sooner then γ2.

&amp;#x200B;

So, before I say my ""intuitive"" thoughts on this, a disclaimer:

Forgive me if I'm just totally wrong, I literally just finished my undergrad physics degree earlier this year and am looking at physics PhD programs for next year. Currently I'm doing material science (condensed matter) research, but I digress...

&amp;#x200B;

Here goes...

Let's say that γ1 hits the detector and we measure its position to be y0. Since γ1 and γ2 are entangled (scraping the ""how do they know about each other"" question out the door), then we'd know that, to produce the ""interference effects"" for γ1, the probabilities that γ2 will hit any detector is no longer 25% each. In other words, the new wavefunction for  where γ2 will end up will change, in accordance with those interference patterns observed. I called this ""partially collapsing the wavefunction of γ2"" and my professor didn't like it... But yeah that's how I see it. After this partial collapse, say the new wavefunction is 

[Assume normalized, a+b+c+d = 1](https://i.redd.it/pxg7u6jsx2q11.png)

Then this system will just behave like any quantum system, and land on the detectors with their corresponding probabilities. (So a chance on A, b chance on B, c chance on C, and d chance on D) When my professor told me you won't be able to distinguish between A and D, and the chances that it's a ""wave"" or a ""particle"" are still 50/50, I just told him, ""Let's add constraints. a = d and a+d = b+c"" Now looking at this... I guess this means that a = 0.25 and d = 0.25... Which seems a bit odd. But I mean, each of these are just for a single event, and to get an ""interference pattern"" for γ1, you'd need multiple events. So I don't see why a and d can't be independent of y0, the position γ1 was measured to be at. And, this phenomena is even easier to explain on a global scale -- since γ1 and γ2 are entangled, you know the state of γ1 if you know the state of γ2, regardless of when you measure what.

Physics,"As the title states, I was wondering, what the opinion of this subreddit on this matter is? I must admit, that going into the field of physics, I was a bit naive - even though nature is extremely fascinating and the study of its workings is a very gratifying activity, the primary goal was to do something momentous, to make a severe impact on this world and be remembered as a man of great achievement, and physics was just the means to achieve this goal(as I said before, it was not by chance; I love physics). I have always been fascinated with great people, no matter the field - Be it composers like Mozart, Beethoven, writers like Goethe or men of science, like Gauss, Euler or Newton and quite often, maybe with too much vanity, dreamed to be among the ranks of these people. However, as I grew more mature, I started to realise, that the time of the ""Hero"" physicist is over. More and more, the emphasis is put on institutional physics(as in, the physics performed by institutions and groups of people working in them) and the importance and value of a single individual often diminishes in comparison to the whole institution. Also, theoretical work has gone so far beyond the means of proving it, that most theoreticians nowadays only get recognition only at the end of their lives. In the end, I would like to say that even though the field of physics is certainly the richest it has ever been, with more knowledge being accumulated every day than ever before, in my opinion, the time of the ""hero"" physicist is certainly over. I think we have more room only for two more chances to become a great of physics - to  unify General Relativity and the Standard Model and explain the origin of non-baryonic matter and dark energy(if the unification does not accomplish this).","Do you sometimes get sad, that the time of the ""romantic"" or ""hero"" individual physicist is pretty much over?",1538507924

Physics,"**Background**

After digging out my science history books and spending too long online, I finally completed this [earlier post of mine](https://www.reddit.com/r/Physics/comments/9fi0n3/nobel_prize_in_physics_19th_century_edition/) about extending the Nobel Prize in Physics to the 19th century. Thanks to /u/KathyLovesPhysics and /u/mnlx for some suggestions.

Here then are **100 prizes from 1801 to 1900 for contributions in the field of physics**. The list follows similar rules to the real Nobel, limiting each prize to at most three living winners. I've omitted 19th century contributions that were already awarded a Nobel (such as Michelson's experiment) but included awards in areas of physics not usually recognised by the Nobel (such as mathematical physics, geophysics and astrophysics). 

There is of course one massive cheat: *hindsight*. Though all the discoveries awarded were recognised to some extent at the time, hindsight allows me to filter out the most significant ones, and (rather cheekily) time the awards so as to minimise the number of omissions due to tragically young deaths (eg Carnot and Hertz at 36).

**A few observations**

* There are three female winners (compared to just two for the real Nobel Prize) though all shared their award: Germain with Poisson and Cauchy for their work on elasticity, Kovalevskaya with Poincaré fortheirher work on Saturn's rings, and Margaret Huggins with her husband William for their work on spectroscopy.

* There are multiple winners with more than one award (compared to just one for the real Nobel Prize), including three winners with more than two: Faraday (5), Biot (3) and Kelvin (3).

* The majority of winners are German, French or British, though there are also a fair number of Americans: Count Rumford (US-born but UK-based), Joseph Henry, Charles Grafton Page, David Alter, Daniel Kirkwood, George William Hill, Josiah Gibbs, Edwin Hall, Nikola Tesla (Yugoslav-born), Thomas Alva Edison and Charles Steinmetz (Prussian-born). 

* I don't know precisely how many Jewish winners there are, but it is certainly vastly fewer than the ~25% for the real Nobel Prize: probably no more than a handful (including Goldstein, Jacobi and the half-Jewish Herschel and Hertz). This is not surprising given the history of Jewish emancipation.

I don’t know how accurate it is but I like to visualize the concept of quantum mechanics like the everett interpretation where information doesn’t get lost by the collapse of the wave function. If this were the case, does this mean that space-time infinity duplicates itself? I really have a hard time interpreting this concept, but it seems like a logical explanation for things like the double slit experiment. Just matter continuing to exist in every possible wave function collapse event.

Now if this was true, couldn’t it mean that dark matter is just the information that diverged right after the big bang creating pockets of matter that wouldn’t be there in other states of the universe, creating these gravitational anomalies? That would also give a good explanation for why dark matter is denser in areas where normal matter is because new divergence points of the wave function of normal matter would accumulate near existing matter and continue the same trajectory as their counterparts. These same events near the time of the big bang would then in turn have made a more drastic impact on other areas. Could it even be the mass/energy of the information itself that accounts for the gravitational influence of dark matter?

I don’t know how well accepted/outdated the everett interpretation is but I was just wondering how all these things tie in together.

I mean, couldn’t it be true that the accelerated expansion of the universe is due to the accumulation of information due to wave functions infinitely duplicating?

THE DUNNING KRUGER EFFECT ON QUANTUM WOO or HOW changes in quantum field states entropy force energy into space

First , I think that I understand quantum physics enough to say this statement is basically true.

:

“a quantum computer could be capable of deriving all possible paths in an infinitely random pathway given you can get the results with out disturbing the state of the stuff your measuring. “

you might want to stop here 

I tried to understand matter as a differential in quantum energy states but my brain farted and I came up with this woo

Now researching for 40 hrs I think I am confirming my own bias

Am I really Unifying space, relativistic matter (as energy )and Newtonian force by describing entropy as a differential between states in causal quantum fields or has misunderstanding and oversimplifying qfd reduced my logic into childish misinterpretations of basic physics (I think this is the case)

Since emergent quantum fields are formulaically identical I followed Occam’s razor and discarded all mathematically identical or redundant fields (since why repeat ) and derived

(understand I cant actually understand these equations … as you will see… but very smart people have made very good linguistic  interpretations’ I  ignorantly overmissimplify to)

St=(f)E (n-j)

This assumes only a Newtonian  field (forces in newton (space?))

And a relativistic  field (stuff energy in joule(time?))

(ive never derived an equation that uses a function before or taken a physics class that teaches how to do it so forgive my poor use of math )

What I think this says is 

Spacetime is a function of entropy expressed as the differential present between the newtonian and relativistic fields 

Some terms

Causality is defined as a condition which space and time have a quanta other than 0 .it is the universe from a perspective where entropy is less than infinite (basically where forces can act on mass in relativistic space time)

Relativistic state is defined as a reference point that has energy (e) and experiences causality . basically a quanta in spacetime  not existing at all points

Entropy is the applied work(joles per space newtons) needed to convert force all matter into spacetime

Zeropoint is defined as 0 mater creating infinite spacetime

Singularity is infinite matter creating 0 spacetime  
 (energy is both infinite and 0 because if matter a=  0 or inf,  energy is non causal.

spacetime  = The  fictitious effects of entropy on Newtonian Relativism 

Spacetime = field  that entropy performs work to equalize the differential between the Newtonian force  at work within/on a system and the relative joules of energy in a system(this assumes the zeropoint is complete entropy)

Pseudo code is as close to a proof as I can get

St = function( n,j){

How n changes j= differential(entropy)

};

So this would return spaceTime entropy = a value in quantized joulenewtons (qjn) 

so one meter second would be the quanta of spacetime transmuted when one newtonspace of force decays into 1 joulsecond of energy this would decrease spacetime

That means space is the amount of newtonjoules over time needed to entropy all force into matter (creating a singularity)this would break space time

And 1 qjn equals the amount of energy  to   1 matter turns spacetime into to force (gravity)

This would accurately describe the conditions of the big bang and actually says that if stuff (  with or without force) is statistically infinite then spacetime should be statistically 0 if stuff is 0 spacetime exists at all possible points.  These mutually exclusive conditions  would exist outside of relative causality so the conservation of matter is not violated.(is this darkness in physic)

Problem is, instead of getting infinitely heavy as you approach c , this predicts that mass will be converted into space time at a rate of 1 metersecond per qjn (and my crazy says it explains the emergent properties of photons as change in QF converting mass into space and (from the photons perspective)expands the photon throughout all space time). This would assert that photons are not able to travel at c because they have no mass but have no mass because they travel at c. would this mean that converting  all mass into force is why light speed is a given value to items that experience causality but fictictious from a non-causal framework???

Im not sure if physics actually states mass becomes denser or if it just breaks down into bad data… but again im going on not knowing the math . im sure I heard that its just a thought experiment. I barely understand physics and I cant even describe this without a word problem.

So does this assert gravity is actually a fictious / emergent force that CAN BE EXPRESSED as space shrinking due to energy converting space into force? Like we aren’t falling but the space is becoming infinitely small and in our frame of reference the space between us and the relativistic mass of the earth is approaching 0.

So would this make gravity a property of relativistic space newtons and photons are then quantized space energy.  I don’t know and im sure ive lost it

So as the woo destroys my logic , it appears that dark energy is all matter as force and dark matter is all force as matter. This actually seems like a perfect answer because according to my derivation : dark energy exists at all points In space time (THEREFORE NON- CAUSAL)and dark matter exists at a point before  energy had mass and time had space

Also this describes  photons as fictitious particles but non fictictious force

Please some one who isn’t completely dumb like me (and actually understands the real) tell me how my misunderstanding of quantum field theory is only surpassed by my inability to form a sequential premise based conclusion. Please tell me all the crazy things I think I proved are evidence that I should never attempt equations outside of a programming environment and that any working code I produce is the clever hans effect.

I've done the typical things people would tell you to do: go and watch videos online, ask your teacher, this and that, but none of it helps. The only thing that has slightly helped was Khan Academy, but I can't apply the knowledge to our work without help.

So the law states that applying a net force to an object will cause it to accelerate, right? F = m\*a, basically.

&amp;#x200B;

A ball is floating in space, essentially still and unmoving. At this point, its velocity is constant. Then, out of nowhere, a huge space boot kicks the ball! Due to the sheer amount of force between the two (the boot is very heavy), the ball accelerates away from the boot! At this point, the net force is no longer zero. But once the boot is no longer interacting with the ball, it drops back to zero, and cruises through space indefinitely at a constant velocity. ~~the end~~

&amp;#x200B;

Please tell me if I'm on the right track or if I'm very lost. Also, I'm not certain on what will happen to the boot.

The idea of the burden of proof applies in situations where there are justifiable default or initial beliefs one should have as answers to questions. For instance, in answer to the question “Is person X guilty of crime Y?” the justifiable default answer is “No,” since we all begin life innocent of any crime. We should not abandon that default belief about person X without specific reasons; therefore, those who claim that person X is guilty must prove their claim. The burden of proof is on them. Another example is the answer to the question, “Is my memory of a life longer than the past five minutes a record of my true history?” The justifiable default answer to this question is “Yes.” We should not abandon the default belief that we are older than  five minutes without specific proof to the contrary.

Of course, when I say that he concluded this, I do not mean that he *accepted* this conclusion, only that this was his initial conclusion. It terrified him, propelling him to propose an alternative that would allow him, as he writes, “**to escape the horror** of a unique position” (*Observational Approach to Cosmology* 46). Decades later, Stephen Hawking also describes this geocentric conclusion as the initial conclusion justified by observation: “Now **at first sight**,” he writes, “all this evidence that the universe looks the same whichever direction we look in might seem to suggest there is something special about our place in the universe. In particular, it might seem that if we observe all other galaxies to be moving away from us, then we must be at the center of the universe” (*A Brief History of Time* 44-45).

Of course, Hawking also rejects this initial conclusion in favor of the alternative: the admirably creative but counter-intuitive idea that there is no center.

So where does the burden of proof lie here? It lies with those who advocate the alternative view, the counter-intuitive view that is not suggested “at first sight.” The simple initial conclusion that we are at the center of the universe is not necessarily the correct one, but any advocate for the alternative must take up the burden of proof and demonstrate that the alternative explanation is better, more justified.

Does Hubble do this? No.  As far as I can tell, he does not even try. He does not even *pretend* to try. He calls the principle on which his alternative explanation rests “sheer assumption”  (*Observational Approach to Cosmology* 42), and he admits that the hypothesis that we are at the center of the universe “cannot be disproved…”  (*Observational Approach to Cosmology* 40). In other words, he admits that the burden of proof cannot be shifted. Hawking agrees, saying “**We have no scientific evidence for, or against, this assumption \[the assumption that the universe has no center\]”**  (*A Brief History of Time* 45).  What Hubble does is *imagine* a coherent scenario in which the universe might have no center, but this is not shifting the burden of proof any more than imagining how someone *might* be guilty of a crime is the same as proving that he *is* guilty the crime. I can *imagine* a scenario in which all my memories beyond five minutes ago have been planted in my brain and do not reflect my true history. Does the fact that I can imagine such a scenario justify believing it?  Of course not.

So what do we have, at the end of the day? We have a justifiable initial explanation of observable facts: We are at the center of the universe. And we have an admission from those who propose the alternative that we are unable to shift the burden of proof required to justify belief in the alternative. Their motives for accepting the alternative explanation in spite of this are simply horror of the first explanation (on the part of Hubble) and sheer refusal to believe its implications on the part of Hawking. As Hawking notes, “We believe it \[the alternative view\] on the grounds of modesty. It would be most remarkable if the universe looked the same in every direction around us, but not around other points in the universe!”  (*A Brief History of Time* 45).

It is remarkable, indeed, and for that reason we should all know about it. In fact, since there are no scientific grounds for thinking otherwise, the geocentric conclusion should, by default, be taught in schools so that each individual has a chance to come to grips with its potential implications about special creation.","Hubble, Hawking, and the Burden of Proof.

Physics,"I think it's dumb that mass is measured in grams. Mass is the amount of matter in an object, but what you are really measuring with grams is the gravitational force between an object and the Earth. If you measured an object's mass on Earth, and then measured the same object with the same amount of matter in it on the moon it would appear to have less mass even though it doesn't. With grams being the unit, to measure the mass of an object anywhere other than Earth you have to know what the acceleration of gravity is relative to Earth's acceleration of gravity, and then convert the measured mass to actual mass using that. But it would be way easier and more accurate to just use a derived unit for mass that dissociates mass from the planet beneath that mass. Which is actually stupidly easy. It's literally just Grams over the acceleration of gravity. For example an object that weighs 100g on Earth would weigh 16.53g on the moon, divide those values by the accelerations of gravity and on earth you would measure a mass of 10.2g/aᵍ ( = 100g / 9.81m/s\^2), and on the moon you would measure a mass of 10.2g/aᵍ ( = 16.53g / 1.62m/s\^2).

People have (kindly) pointed out possible hazards and (rightfully) criticized my method of inquiry, but no one really responded to the central question: ""Could a single wax candle change the physics of a room in some way to aid a combustion process a few feet/meters away?"" So I hope it's okay if I re-post this here.*

Hey everybody!

Here's an odd question, but I assure you, it's the truth: I live in an apartment with two gas radiators. As far as I can tell, each has its own pump as well as a some sort of spark-ignition. When I turn it on, I hear the pump going and I can hear the repeated clicking noise of the ignition. Sometimes it takes a few minutes before the heating starts to work, and sometimes it doesn't work at all.

Now, radiator 1 works every time. Radiator 2 only at times. It was pretty cold last winter, so sometimes, while waiting for the radiator to work, I lit a candle. And at some point this became a ritual, and - one that worked. So before summer came I started a series of tests, documenting every instance of starting the radiator, in all possible permutations:

4/4  candle lit -&gt; heating works; 4/5 candle lit -&gt; heating works; 4/6  no candle -&gt; no heating; 4/7 no candle -&gt; no heating; 4/8 no  candle -&gt; no heating; 4/8 candle lit -&gt; heating works; 4/10 candle  lit -&gt; heating works; 4/11 no candle -&gt; no heating; 4/11 candle  lit -&gt; heating works; 4/12 no candle -&gt; no heating; 4/13 no candle  -&gt; no heating; 4/14 candle lit -&gt; heating works.

So yeah, **the radiator only works when I light a candle in the room**.  In a later test I found out that the heating also works when I light the candle before the fact and then blow it out during the ignition process.

Some extra facts: That radiator had a gas leak a while back, it's mounted to the wall tilted slightly to  the left, I think the gas is methane, the candle is a household wax candle about 2 meters away from the radiator, and, most importantly, I  haven't lost my marbles. Really!

Is it possible that the vaporized wax helps with the combustion process? Or do you have any other idea? **Why could that be?**

Thank you!

[Example video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aZ7M44JPKRk) of a (random) sword ""flex test"" that closely emulates how the blade would react when thrusting into a resistive target. The guy in the video is pushing at ~45 degrees from perpendicular-to-the-target, but in actual use maybe it'd be closer to 20 or 30 degrees. 


[Example picture](http://historicaltwiststore.com/images/product/05-160.jpg) to demonstrate roughly the amount of curve I am referring to (a very slight curve). 


My thought process is, that when a thrust is given into a resistive target (let's say a tree), the sword ""flexes"" (like in the example video, but probably not to that extreme). If the sword blade is slightly curved (like in the example picture), my mind tells me that a portion of the force that causes the blade to flex would be ""transformed"" into a ""twisting force"" (because of the curve of the blade). 


Since the tip of the ""slightly curved sword"" is not very far from the center point, any ""twisting"" in the blade would not displace the point very far, and while the blade is slightly twisted, this should (in hypothesis) slightly alter the shape of the blade to slightly aid in preventing the ""flexing"" (by providing more structural integrity on the ""perpendicular to the edge"" axis). 


Also, because of the curve, a fraction of the force would probably be used in rotating the sword (in the ""strong"" axis, the axis of the blade). This would probably also factor in. 


Generally it's understood that the more a blade flexes in the thrust, the less of the force is transferred directly into the target, and that is why ""less flex"" is better. 


So I count 3 distinctly different interactions that *could potentially* aid in making a ""slightly curved sword"" stiffer in the thrust compared to a straight sword of the same design/dimensions/material.

Physics,"Ive thought that the uncertainty seen at the quantum level is the result of relativistic frames of reference converging to agree on the behavior of a particle at a specific point in time

This thought asserts that the uncertain nature of the behavior of particles results from a diverse set of reference frames agreeing that the particle is in a particular position in space but not agreeing on the events that led to that particle being exactly at that position. As a result, the specific details of that particles future behavior cannot be predicted due to the incongruous nature of its history. Thus, statistical models must be relied upon

This is further suggested by the double slit experiment where an electron beam fired at two slits would result in an interference pattern when not observed at the point of entry at the two slits, a behavior that suggests a wave structure passing through. However when measured as they passed they result in a pattern that would suggest discrete particles. This can be explained by the presence of multiple frames of reference. While not observed, the frames of reference cannot be 100% certain as to the direction, momentum, or position of the particle as it enters the slits. But as soon as the particle is measured as it enters, it forces all frames of reference observing the particle to agree on an aspect of that particle, which restricts the particles history to one that would result in its specific position/momentum. By restricting that particles history, the particles future behavior is restricted to having been at that particular spot/momentum at that particular time.

Physics,"Hello all,

So as I understand it, when Einstein performed his thought experiments with regards to gravity, he pictured a man in an elevator and when the elevator dropped, in a sense the man became weightless. The conventional Newtonian theory suggested that gravity was attracting objects and pulling them, but Einstein theorized that it was actually space/time which was pushing the man down and that objects displace space/time. I'm trying to understand it conceptually, but having some trouble. Is space-time similar to a fabric or perhaps like water? If the man is in the elevator, I am picturing this space-time fabric as a visible blanket (for the sake of understanding) wrapping over top (as well as underneath) the man, and another blanket over top and underneath the elevator, and a multitude of other blankets layering and encapsulating all the other objects that are in the elevator which are causing this displacement; and these blankets are pushing down upon the objects.

Physics,"Hello physics people,

I was sitting on the train looking over my chemistry work when this random question popped up in my head. If we were to have a vacuum chamber large enough to support a free fall, if one were to jump would the pattern their body falls in be random with no chance of steering where there body goes? Typically during a fall, people will control the way they are falling by adjusting there body and by using air resistance, but since there is no air, would they be able to even turn their body in the first place? Another question, if a person was to jump and do a flip and begin to free fall, would they be able to stop the turning of their body? Or would it be like space where you just continuously turn?

The environmental issues of gasoline production and combustion are not new topics. The perfect and complete combustion of gasoline would result in the production of water and carbon dioxide alone, however this is not the case in current automobile motors. Gasoline has many hazardous biproducts due to incomplete combustion. Nitrogen oxides produced contribute to heightened levels of particulate matter, acid rain, and ozone levels on earths surface. Unburned Hydrocarbons (UHC’s) emitted by car engines not being perfect systems are released into the air and have adverse effects on a human body, even causing cancer in the case of the hydrocarbon Benzene. 

The production of Gasoline is a distillation of petroleum, or crude oil, which is a fossil fuel. So, the substance we use to power our cars every day is produced through the use and burning of fossil fuels, and results in many air pollutants being pumped out of our exhaust pipes into the atmosphere, including very high amounts of carbon dioxide, a greenhouse gas. Carbon Dioxide emissions from gasoline use each year pumped over 1.26 trillion kilograms of the gas into our atmosphere in the year of 2019. This all is a frighteningly hazardous chemical process that takes place through over 142 billion gallons of gas used in the United States during the year of 2019 (390 Million gallons a day). 

Companies have started to take note of this harmful backbone of the transportation industry and have come up with solutions that are just manifesting in our world today. Major manufacturers such as Honda, Hyundai, and Toyota have begun production of Fuel Cell Electric Vehicles (FCEV’s) for sale in the year of 2020. 

Cars that run off of Hydrogen fuel cells are much safer for our environment than gasoline powered automobiles *and* electric cars. High end electric cars take power from the grid, meaning that they still run off of the burning of coal and natural gas, solving no real problems. FCEV’s are different. The hydrogen fuel cells they run off of work by converting the chemical potential energy of hydrogen and oxygen atoms by combining the two, to produce electricity. This results in only heat and water as its biproducts! The newest hydrogen power cell technology shows promising ability to power cars in less than four minutes, yielding a driving distance of up to 300 miles!

With this new fuel cell technology, there are hopes to reduce the production and use of gasoline one car at a time!

The advice I was given using my 2 mg pill,  to add  1 to 2 ml  of **Propylene glycol** per 1 mg of pill making it 2 to 4 mg **PG**  for a  2 mg pill , then add 100 ml of water which would make it a suspension .

And  that there is no need to shake it, as the Diazepam would be equally  distributed throughout  just subtract small amounts with a  syringe  daily.

I was also told to minus  the amount of PG from the water e.g if you use 2 mg PG then use 98 ml of  water+2 mg of PG which would then=100 ml, and subtract my daily micro   cut from there. 

Will this actually be a true safe suspension to use?","Advice needed please for making a ""homemade"" Diazepam Solution using PG ( Propylene glycol) to do a daily micro liquid taper (DMLT)",1600261760

I guess capsaicin is alkaline, since I saw an episode of the show Hot Ones where Gordan Ramsey is guzzling lemon juice in response to the spice.

If that's the case, then might not cooking your spicy dish denature the molecules as well?

Additionally, I'm not wild about the vapors that would be produced.

Instead, I wanted to attempt refining the antimony from solution, and I elected to dissolve a decent amount of it in HCl. I did this outdoors because of the nasty H2S gas produced, and after a while I was left with a solution of (presumably) SbCl3 and some unreacted Sb2S3, which was filtered off. I then attempted the easiest reduction I could think of, which was to simply add aluminum to the solution. 

This resulted in a large amount of dark grey precipitate flecked with ""silver"" speckles. There is a possibility that the speckles are actually tiny pieces of unreacted Al, but I'm not certain.

I am running a small hydroponics system to grow some herbs and lettuce at STEM camp I am working at and looking for a scalable way to clean large amounts of expanded clay pellets.

Cleaning expanded clay pellets for reuse in hydroponics involves removing organic material, sand formed from pellets clay rubbing together, and then sanitizing.  This is commonly done through a combination of rinsing, boiling, bleach soak, and handpicking roots.  The issue is that its rather tedious as you scale up and I feel like there should be a **way to remove organic material chemically.**

We currently have 50 L of expanded clay pellets and that will need to cleaned sooner rather or later. Additionally, we have:

Citric Acid

Copper Sulfate

Baking Soda

Bleach

Dilute Hydrogen Peroxide

Vinegar 

Could buy off the shelf chemicals if the solution works. 

Also, sodium and copper ions are rather toxic to plants. Nutrient Solutions usually keep those below 0.1 PPM.

We hope to be a showcase for creative writing in, around, and about science, scientists, and the interaction between science and society, and so foster an understanding of science as an emotional and artistic endeavour.

We publish creative non-fiction and fiction about science, scientists, and the interaction of science and society. You can find us on Instagram &amp; Twitter @tamarindlitmag and our [editor's bios are here](https://tamarindlit.co.uk/?page=about).

Pieces should be between 1,500 to 5,000 words long and we accept simultaneous and multiple submissions. We don’t require first or exclusive rights to your work (though naturally if it is unpublished we will end up with first rights). We're sadly not accepting poetry because none of us feel qualified to judge it.

**Non-fiction**: we accept submissions for essays and opinion pieces about the interaction of science with society and histories and biographies of science and scientists.

**Fiction**: we'd like stories that have realistic portrayals of science, scientists, and their impact on society. This includes things like [lab lit](http://www.lablit.com/) and sci-fi with a more literary bend to it. As another example, take a look at *[(Nothing but) Art](http://sciencechallenge.org/2019-winners/leroi-ic-1.pdf)* written by our fiction editor.

chemistry,"Hi I am working on trying to electrolyse a solution of 2-bromo-2-methylpropanoate. Basically this compound has a C-Br bond which can be reduced, that is, the bond can be cleaved by electrochemical reduction. This cleaving of the bond should generate isobutyrate carbon radicals and a bromide ion. The process of reduction is irreversible since the carbon radicals formed should couple together to form a dimer of the isobutyrate molecule rather than returning to the electrode to be oxidised - the butyrate is reduced but never re oxidised.

Any who, I am trying to do this reaction by applying a constant potential to reduce the molecule and generate the dimer. I am using the IKA elektrasyn 2.0, with a Pt counter electrode, slim glassy carbon electrode (diameter is about a millimeter), and Ah/AgCl reference electrode. I use 1 mM of the isobutyrate with 100 mM of KCl background electrolyte.

When I run a constant potential on the IKA, I get the error in the title. It is impossible that the vial is not connected as it is possible to do CV measurements on it so the vial must be connected. That points to the resistance being too high.

There is more than enough background electrolyte: a 100x excess of electrolyte compared to 1mM analyte so the error makes no sense.

The most likely cause of the issue might be that the carbon working electrode is too small, meaning the surface area is too high and thus the reaction cannot progress. I may try to use the other, bigger carbon electrode.

Any tips?",Error with IKA Elektrasyn 2.0 - Vial Not Connected or Resistance too High,1596053077

Lye is added to some kind of liquid (usually water) to make a solution that you then add to fat. The lye and the fat react and create soap. You add more oil than the lye can react with, so at the end you're left with a bar that's soap, water and a small (3-10% usually) amount of purposefully leftover oil. 

So things are going well with selling soap, except for a few people in my life that are...misinformed.

She however doesn't believe me, saying ""It's like a cake recipe, you can't see the eggs but they're still in there and a person who's allergic to eggs couldn't eat it."".

Forgive me if this is the wrong sub, but I have a serious problem, and I don't know where to look.

**Backstory**

* My family and I live on a farm. My dad uses sulphur to spray the plants / trees.
* One of those plants is a 100 year old grapvine that growns directly on the side of the house.

**The problem**

* Everytime my dad sprays the plants, the house becomes contaminated by sulphur smell.
* The smell lingers in the house for days. 
* It is burning my eyes and making it water. My mother also has the same problem.

**What we tried**

* We tried ventilating the house, but many of the windows are old and don't open. 
* The ones which do open are behind the grapevine, so they only bring more sulphur into the house.

We spoke to my dad, but the sulphur does not affect him, so he does not believe it is a problem and is refusing to do anything about the problem.

So I would like to know if there is any way, perhaps with common house chemicals that I can use to clean the air of sulphur. It's in the bedrooms now and won't got out and our eyes are burning.

The environmental issues of gasoline production and combustion are not new topics. The perfect and complete combustion of gasoline would result in the production of water and carbon dioxide alone, however this is not the case in current automobile motors. Gasoline has many hazardous biproducts due to incomplete combustion. Nitrogen oxides produced contribute to heightened levels of particulate matter, acid rain, and ozone levels on earths surface. Unburned Hydrocarbons (UHC’s) emitted by car engines not being perfect systems are released into the air and have adverse effects on a human body, even causing cancer in the case of the hydrocarbon Benzene. 

The production of Gasoline is a distillation of petroleum, or crude oil, which is a fossil fuel. So, the substance we use to power our cars every day is produced through the use and burning of fossil fuels, and results in many air pollutants being pumped out of our exhaust pipes into the atmosphere, including very high amounts of carbon dioxide, a greenhouse gas. Carbon Dioxide emissions from gasoline use each year pumped over 1.26 trillion kilograms of the gas into our atmosphere in the year of 2019. This all is a frighteningly hazardous chemical process that takes place through over 142 billion gallons of gas used in the United States during the year of 2019 (390 Million gallons a day). 

Companies have started to take note of this harmful backbone of the transportation industry and have come up with solutions that are just manifesting in our world today. Major manufacturers such as Honda, Hyundai, and Toyota have begun production of Fuel Cell Electric Vehicles (FCEV’s) for sale in the year of 2020. 

Cars that run off of Hydrogen fuel cells are much safer for our environment than gasoline powered automobiles *and* electric cars. High end electric cars take power from the grid, meaning that they still run off of the burning of coal and natural gas, solving no real problems. FCEV’s are different. The hydrogen fuel cells they run off of work by converting the chemical potential energy of hydrogen and oxygen atoms by combining the two, to produce electricity. This results in only heat and water as its biproducts! The newest hydrogen power cell technology shows promising ability to power cars in less than four minutes, yielding a driving distance of up to 300 miles!

With this new fuel cell technology, there are hopes to reduce the production and use of gasoline one car at a time!

Is this because carbon can be fused in stars while silicon would have to be formed in some kind of stellar explosion like a supernova? And does that mean as the universe ages, there will be more and more silicon (+ other elemental) based life? 

- While I'm here, I also can't remember what makes water such a special molecule.It seems so strange to me that it's the only substance I can think of that is *less* dense as a solid than it is a liquid. Are there any other molecules like that? Could another molecule support life as well as water? Would a silicon based life-form still need water? Would the need oxygen??

I’m no chemist or scientist but I’m in need of help that I can’t seem to find an answer for online.

Basically I’m making an affordable ointment for horse hooves for a fungal issue they get and need it to both work and stick to the underside of their hooves for as long as possible.

The ointment base is a paraffin based emulsion and because of this has an oily feel to it.

This has lead me to Bentonite clay as a possible ingredient in the ointment to decrease the oiliness and increase the stickability but I see that it supposedly absorbs copper and other metals. 

I’m planning on adding the clay to the emulsion in the water phase  and adding the copper sulphate in the cool down phase.

For this reason I have been hesitant to use the aforementioned smoke sources out of a concern that they would deposit a fine residue on the reeds. (I'm not concerned about the rest of the instrument.)

I've been trying to find out if either of those chemicals will ever evaporate. My understanding is that they are resistant to evaporation (e.g. glycerine apparently [having a vapor pressure](http://www.aciscience.org/docs/physical_properties_of_glycerine_and_its_solutions.pdf) on the order of .0001 to .001mmHg at room temperature -- which is 0.0133 Pa to 0.133 Pa if my understanding is correct) but I can't seem to figure out what that means for me: for example, if the residue evaporates in a few hours or days, that's fine with me. If it's going to take months, or will never happen, that's a deal-breaker.

It's not possible to clean the reeds afterwards as one side of them is inaccessible. If there was a simple cleaning agent (e.g. soap?) it might be possible to submerge the instrument in some kind of bath for the sake of cleaning, but I'd very much like to avoid that.

Anyone have any guidance here? If there are alternative smoke sources, e.g. those that leave truly no, or truly negligible, residue, I'd love to hear about them. I'm currently investigating ultrasonic mist/fog machines... possibly a large model might make enough fog to be useful. (The ""smoke"" doesn't have to linger long, just a second or two while it's blown through the instrument.)

Or maybe I'm worrying needlessly about the glycerine/PG residue?

chemistry,"As a statistics student who is going to be doing some applied statistics research using metabolomics, I have to work with MS data. I took introductory chemistry and biochem 3 years ago... but we never went into how to use MS data for analysis (and nothing on NMR). I have a few questions I hope this community can help with. I find it's hard to discover simplified material that answers my specific questions while also being understandable.

1. Does a larger peak area in MS data mean there is a higher concentration of the metabolite? How about for NMR data? Is there even a difference in what the data from NMR and MS is telling you?
2. If you have a standard solutions made for a known metabolite that means the peak area generated for that metabolite can be converted to a concentration (this is my understanding, please roast me if I'm wrong). Let's say you have some metabolites with a known standard solutions that can be converted to concentration. Then you have some that don't have standard solutions and are left as peak area. Traditionally, a statistics education would says to simply standardize (subtract mean and divide by the standard error) each metabolite to make things no longer on unit scale. However, I'm not sure if that makes sense for peak area data as I'm not sure what a larger peak area value means. I assume this okay as you can think of the peak area as just some continuous value so I don't see why everything couldn't just be standardized and then analyzed.
3. Any general tips on how to pre-process metabolites before analyzing it when no standard solution is available? Even textbooks you'd recommend?

chemistry,"Hi, 

I have equation (1.1) shown below that is applicable to isothermal conditions only. I'm trying to apply this equation to non-isothermal conditions. It means that I can predict the evolution of log(G\*) from equation (1.1) for any duration at a single temperature. However, what I have is an hourly temperature history that I'd like to use to predict the evolution of log(G\*). This is where I got lost.

What I did was derive equation (1.4) from equation (1.1) hoping that I can use it to get the slope at every time-step, such that at each time-step, I would have a different temperature. However, as you can see in equation (1.4), I have the time t appearing in the exponential. Should I be using the total time up to the point of interest?

I'm currently in undergraduate studying Chemistry, but I already know I want to continue studying it in graduate school. I've thought long and hard about this; I know I'll enjoy research because I've been working in a lab at my university and it hasn't gotten dull even with the repetitive reaction sequence I run. I also love to read random publications for fun to learn about the deeper chemistry, so that doesn't seem like a task at all. I am aware of the work that needs to be put in, but I'd rather that than not be challenged.

I wanted to make a second post discussing the feedback I received from that post and my actions going forward with this.

I was up very late Monday night contemplating on what I wanted to do with my life, and the idea of making Organic Chemistry-related content on Youtube crossed my mind again, and I decided to post just to share my thoughts with others. I NEVER would have expected to receive so much upvotes and comments on my post. It's still mind-blowing to me, and in a way, kind of life-changing.

I want to first thank all of you for your positive reception and feedback. Becoming a Youtube part-time is something I was always interested in and doing this type of content would be very fun. The positive reception I received has breathed new life into making this a reality, and it has given me the motivation to do so.

First, it may take some time (estimate 3-4 weeks, but **subject to change**) to put out my first video. For the upcoming weeks I will be busy completing my current internship. Also, I'm fairly new to making videos and, rather than rushing something, I want to put in a lot of effort to make sure that I produce something that's high quality.

* I'm going to invest in a decent microphone (if any of you have suggestions do let me know).
* In terms of how I'm going to record content, I've been thinking of using Manim (it's the stuff that 3b1b uses for his videos). A while back, someone on this subreddit posted a modified version of Manim called Chanim for use with chemistry-related content. I'm in the process of having that installed on my laptop and learning how to utilize it. Hopefully my laptop is decent enough where I can produce a smooth video.

I don't want to lose any of your guys' interests regarding this, so I do plan on giving some updates as to the progress I've made. I do have a Youtube channel I made a couple of months ago but haven't touched since: [https://www.youtube.com/channel/UC-GI0e2HT-IRFropwzZogTQ](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UC-GI0e2HT-IRFropwzZogTQ). I currently have the name of the channel as ""Walter Brown"" (which is a joke on Walter White from Breaking Bad). I'm open to any name suggestions, but I do feel comfortable adopting some sort of alias rather than having to use my own personal name.

If you'd like to receive updates from me about this, I **highly recommend** you either **subscribe** to my Youtube channel, and/or **follow me on Reddit.** It will be easier for me to make posts and connect with you guys more. I could also make posts to this subreddit, but I want to limit how much I post to allow for everyone else to post about other chemistry-related things.

I achieved 100% conversion of the methyl ester by TLC, which was confirmed by HPLC-UV. However, my yield of 4-hydroxycinnamic acid at the endpoint is only 60%mol, confirmed by a similar crystallization yield. The HPLC calibration is recent and a sample at t=0 gives the correct concentration, so I have little reason to suspect that the analytical is at fault.   


At such gentle hydrolysis conditions, I can't think of what this compound could be converting to. Am I missing a possible side reaction? For it to disappear from the HPLC-UV I figure the aromatic ring would have to be converted but that shouldn't be possible.",Where is my organic acid going?,1586358476

Apologies if this is not the right reddit board for this. 

## Dried Magnesium Sulphate BP Magnesium Sulfate

Dried Epsom Salts  
**Magnesium Sulphate Dried is offered in BP grade**  
Preparation  
Magnesium Sulphate Paste

**DEFINITION**  
Dried Magnesium Sulphate contains not less than 62.0% and not more than 70.0% of MgSO4.  
It may be prepared by drying magnesium sulphate at 100° until it has lost approximately 25% of its weight.

**CHARACTERISTICS**  
A white powder.  
Freely soluble in water; dissolves more rapidly in hot water.

**IDENTIFICATION**  
Yields the reactions characteristic of magnesium salts and of sulphates.

**TESTS**  
Acidity or alkalinity  
To 10 ml of a 7.5% w/v solution in carbon dioxide-free water add 0.05 ml of phenol red solution. Not more than 0.2 ml of either 0.01M hydrochloric acid VS or 0.01M sodium hydroxide VS is required to change the colour of the solution.  
Arsenic  
0.33 g dissolved in 25 ml of water complies with the limit test for arsenic, (3 ppm).  
Heavy metals  
Dissolve 1.3 g in 20 ml of water and add 1 g of ammonium chloride. 12 ml of the resulting solution complies with limit test A for heavy metals, Appendix VII. Use lead standard solution(1 ppm Pb) to prepare the standard (15 ppm).  
Iron  
0.33 g dissolved in 10 ml of water complies with the limit test for iron, Appendix VII (30 ppm).  
Chloride  
0.13 g dissolved in 15 ml of water complies with the limit test for chlorides, Appendix VII (400 ppm).  
Insoluble matter  
7.5 g dissolves in 20 ml of water, producing a solution which may be slightly turbid at first but which becomes clear in a few minutes.

chemistry,"I'm looking for help in figuring out if 91% iso used as a solvent to infuse the salvinorin from some extracts I bought onto corn starch will also remove the lipids and I'm guessing plant fats that are necessary for quidding methods (sublingual and buccal absorptions) ? I'm assuming because I'm trying something with already standardized extracts that someone created for use with regular leaf there will already be much of the tannins and other components useful for sublingual methods removed from the salvia during the original extraction process used to make the fortified leaf. I'm hoping it's a crude extract. So I'm wondering from someone with a scientific mind with knowledge in chemistry if they think 91% isopropyl would still be a good solvent for extracting the salvinorin from the already bought extracts or if too much of the tannins were removed if I should use vegetable glycerin with white vinegar instead. The original creator of this Tek for a proper quid method used 3 washes of 91% iso with regular leaf not extract for his most potent results. Originally he used vegetable glycerin with white vinegar and it worked too . So to round up my main question do you think I could successfuly extract the salvinorin A from extract not from regular leaf with 3 warm 91% iso washes or should I try 1 wash because the might remove all the tannins and lipids or whatever it is I need for sublingual absorption. I plan on using this very responsibly in very small amounts for subtle doses. I am 30 and don't want to smoke because of cov19 and I'm going to be safe and cautious and am responsible.

chemistry,"Fischer esterification is straightforward when making esters from small alcohols, up to 5-carbon alcohols, because water washes can remove any remaining alcohol in workup.

Once you get to 6 carbons and higher, water washes are unable to remove the alcohol from the crude ester, and this affects the smell.

Larger esters, such as octyl acetate and nonyl acetate, have interesting smells. octyl acetate is citrus, orange, earthy, while nonyl acetate is mushroom, but the presence of residual 1-octanol and 1-nonanol can contaminate the smell.

One way is to have the reaction go to completion, so that all the alcohol is used up. Use an excess of carboxylic acid, since it can be easily neutralized to its carboxylate salt and extracted with water. Instead of using acid chlorides or anhydrides, which are harder to get, you can use the Dean-Stark method for fischer esterification, which dissolves all reactants and catalysts in toluene, and uses a Dean-stark trap to capture formed water. A nice thing about this method is that you can track reaction progress by looking at the volume of water in the trap, and once water stops forming, the reaction is done.",Synthesis of pure esters from long-chain alcohols using Fischer esterification,1585088774

In my free time, I love studying ancient chemistry.

I read a work by johann Glauber , one of the first chemical engeneer called ""la consolation des navigants "". At one point he talks about ""spirit of salt"" aka HCl.

I know this author already covered the synthesis of HCl by distilling sea salt (NaCl) with roman vitriol (FeSO4,n H2O). The mechanism is pretty straight forward : the sulfate decompose into sulfuric acid and react with NaCl to produce HCl.

This mechanism is well known and still used today.

However in this work he talks about another way he makes his ""spirit of salt"". He takes clay and cook it into little bals. Once done he let them absorb a concentrated solution of NaCl. After that he dry distill the balls into a receiver containing water.

I must say I don't understand how salt could decompose into either Cl2 or HCl with heat just like that. I didn't saw any modern day equivalent of this mechanism. Also what difference could clay make compared to trying to distill a pile of salt (wich obviously doesn't work).

What do you think ? Is it theoretically possible or is it just another mistake in old chemistry books ? What is the mechanism behind it ? Could it be another compound that would have been mistaken for HCl ?

The environmental issues of gasoline production and combustion are not new topics. The perfect and complete combustion of gasoline would result in the production of water and carbon dioxide alone, however this is not the case in current automobile motors. Gasoline has many hazardous biproducts due to incomplete combustion. Nitrogen oxides produced contribute to heightened levels of particulate matter, acid rain, and ozone levels on earths surface. Unburned Hydrocarbons (UHC’s) emitted by car engines not being perfect systems are released into the air and have adverse effects on a human body, even causing cancer in the case of the hydrocarbon Benzene. 

The production of Gasoline is a distillation of petroleum, or crude oil, which is a fossil fuel. So, the substance we use to power our cars every day is produced through the use and burning of fossil fuels, and results in many air pollutants being pumped out of our exhaust pipes into the atmosphere, including very high amounts of carbon dioxide, a greenhouse gas. Carbon Dioxide emissions from gasoline use each year pumped over 1.26 trillion kilograms of the gas into our atmosphere in the year of 2019. This all is a frighteningly hazardous chemical process that takes place through over 142 billion gallons of gas used in the United States during the year of 2019 (390 Million gallons a day). 

Companies have started to take note of this harmful backbone of the transportation industry and have come up with solutions that are just manifesting in our world today. Major manufacturers such as Honda, Hyundai, and Toyota have begun production of Fuel Cell Electric Vehicles (FCEV’s) for sale in the year of 2020. 

Cars that run off of Hydrogen fuel cells are much safer for our environment than gasoline powered automobiles *and* electric cars. High end electric cars take power from the grid, meaning that they still run off of the burning of coal and natural gas, solving no real problems. FCEV’s are different. The hydrogen fuel cells they run off of work by converting the chemical potential energy of hydrogen and oxygen atoms by combining the two, to produce electricity. This results in only heat and water as its biproducts! The newest hydrogen power cell technology shows promising ability to power cars in less than four minutes, yielding a driving distance of up to 300 miles!

With this new fuel cell technology, there are hopes to reduce the production and use of gasoline one car at a time!

chemistry,"I am going to get a BWT brand water filter pitcher.  As part of its filtration it has a WAC resin.  I found a warning about WAC water filters and chloride and sulfate, please see below, where it states that WAC filters turn chloride into hydrochloric acid and sulfate into sulfuric acid.   


I am using well water.    Per a water analysis my water has both chloride and  sulfate it, although both seem pretty low.  Chloride is 43.0 mg/L and Sulfate is 6.8 mg/L.  The EPA national standard for either is 250 mg/L  So my water has much lower than acceptable standards.   So I assume any hydrochloric acid or sulfuric acid formed would be small.  Also, the same write-up indicates that with a different filter brands WAC, the unsafe levels would be chloride 80 ppm and sulfate 150ppm. I think mg/L is a straight conversion to ppm, so I would be at 43ppm and 6.8ppm, respectively

Or would this be a health concern?

Also, if it causes either of those acids in an unsafe amount, would I be able to tell by measuring the overall water's pH?  I have general pH taste strips I can use to test the water's pH.   If they show no material change toward acidic for the water, would it be safe to assume the water is safe? 

&amp;#x200B;

What I found:   *However, but I want to call your attention to another potential cause for an unusually low pH reading after using Claris for filtering your water: chloride (Cl-) and sulfates (SO4(2-)). These anions are not typically present in significant concentrations in municipal water, but if they are, they can interact very poorly with the Claris softener (or any other WAC ion exchange softener). The H+ that is bled into the water by the ion exchange forms hyrdochloric (HCl) or sulfuric (H2SO4) acid that can reduce the pH dangerously and lead to corrosion of stainless steel, not to mention copper/brass.*  


*Everpure recommends that if you have water that has* ***chloride levels above 80ppm*** *or* ***sulfate levels above 150ppm****, you should* ***not*** *use Claris (or any other WAC ion exchange softener), and should consider a filtration solution that will remove or reduce the chloride and sulfates, such as RO with blending or remineralization.* 

 *Here is the text of the summary from the Everpure/Pentair document on when to use Claris:*  


* *All weak acid cation (WAC) softening products perform with similar chemistry requirements.*
* *Claris (like other WAC products) is great for water with bicarbonate levels above 100 &amp; low chloride and sulfate levels (less than 80ppm and 150ppm respectively).*
* *\[Claris\] Maintains beneficial minerals for quality coffee - Protects equipment from scale formation.*
* *Water with high acid risk (high chloride and or sulfate levels) should consider reverse osmosis technology for removal.*

There are numerous reasons why these kinds of materials are gaining the popularity that they are. To say, these materials have a high ROI, consumer satisfaction is much more than any kind of technology when it comes to molecular and atomic scales. Due to the advantages that these materials avail, many companies are investing in it with the thought of making changes in their products and services. 

Many advanced materials conferences have highlighted the below-listed factors that have a positive influence on advanced materials technology. 

# Intelligent computing systems

As technology is advancing at lightning-fast speed, it is giving rise to the introduction of smart computing devices that are making tasks simpler and faster to implement. As a result, these intelligent computing systems are proving to be a medium of growth for advanced material technology and bringing in various novel innovations. 

# Development of more complex products

One of the popularly known conferences like advanced materials congress conducts presentations and speeches that express the progress and development of a lot of products and services that are complex in nature and are contributing to the success of this technological evolution. 

# R&amp;D and innovation

Science is a field that requires a lot of research and development. The reason for the utmost innovation in this field is continuous research. The amount of exploration done leads to various transformations coming into picture which has only positive outcomes. The constant R&amp;D and innovations taking place only prove to be a push to the never-ending changes in this industry.     

# Advanced manufacturing processes

The rate at which products are developed and manufactured is an important part of their success. The reason being, if the demand for a particular product is high, having a good stock of that product ready only gives rise to more demand and thus the product does not lose out on customers only because of its unavailability. 

# Intellectual property

A lot of advanced materials conferences discuss the importance of advanced material and the significance it has in the field of science. Hence, due to the development of many such materials, there is a greater rise in the number of intellectual properties. More and more trademarks are being introduced in the market.  

# Potential profitability &amp; market share

The growth of different types of advanced materials increases their marketability. This leads to a consequence of the growth in the market share of these materials. Due to the potential demand that these materials hold in the market, it gives a self-activating purpose to the growth of each of these materials.",Concepts Contributing to the Success of Advanced Materials,1577777361
chemistry,"I know there are a few bleach related posts here but I wanted to find out if my specific situation is cause for alarm, my apologies if I shouldn't be posting this.

Okay so I'm housesitting for a friend, and just noticed that the fabric softener dispener in their washing machine had mould in it. I'd been using the machine for a couple of weeks so theoretically it hasn't been harmful, but I sort of have a phobia/hatred for mould and things that can grow, spread and become bigger issues, so I got to cleaning. 

I haven't been independent for long so I'm still learning a lot of important household maintenance, so I Googled ""How to clean a fabric softener dispenser"" and found this:

[https://www.wikihow.com/Clean-a-Fabric-Softener-Dispenser](https://www.wikihow.com/Clean-a-Fabric-Softener-Dispenser)

Now if you scroll down to the 'Cleaning the Dispenser Manually' section, it says:

 ""In a large bowl or a bucket, create a solution of 1 gallon (3.78 liters) warm water, ¼ cup (2 ounces) of liquid dish detergent, and 1 cup (8 ounces) of bleach.""

So I did this. We'll return to this point a bit later but I'll continue from here. I got a bucket (the only bucket in the house believe it or not), poured in water, dish detergent and bleach approximately following the above ratio and it honestly seemed ok, it got soapy and (understandably) smelt a bit chemical-ish, but seems like nothing too horrible (I don't know how bleach smells on its own because I kept my face well away from it). So I started cleaning the removable part of the fabric softener dispenser, with gloves on and keeping my face turned away as much as possible, and then saw the floor getting wet. Turns out the only bucket in the house has a crack in the bottom, so I quickly moved it into the laundry sink, but at least the dispenser was perfecly clean.

So now I had some bleachy-detergenty water on the floor, so I dried it all up with some paper towels. In the meantime, I moved onto the ""Cleaning a Non-removable Dispenser"" section because there was grime and mould in the other parts of the fabric softener mechanism. So I poured in dish detergent and water into the dispenser, and added a little bit of bleach because the mixture was so effective before. Now I also had some laundry powder in the machine which I forgot about because I was going to clean some clothes before I noticed this mould. I then put the machine on hot and the longest rinse cycle to give it a good clean (hopefully). So to quickly reiterate, I deviated from the instructions slightly and had: dish detergent, a small amount of bleach and a small capful of laundry powder.

I then looked back to the floor where that mixture leaked earlier and thought I should clean it more or rinse it with water because walking on bleached floor would be bad for your skin. So I grabbed the closest water I could see which was a spray bottle of approximately 70% water and 30% vinegar (all the cleaning supplies are right next to where I was). After I started spraying, I quickly remembered reading that vinegar and bleach is an extremely dangerous combination, so I left the room,  opened all the doors and windows with a towel over my face, grabbed my phone and laptop and went upstairs which brings me to this point of anxiously reading things and becoming concerned about my stupid errors. 

&amp;#x200B;

I've read that important information would be the dish detergent used, as some contain ammonia or ammonia-derived compounds (I'm not sure what those would be called). So I used this, and it's worth mentioning that it doesn't say anywhere on the labels not to mix it with bleach, which apparently all detergents with ammonia are supposed to:

I've read some scary things like bleach mixed with certain chemicals can create an invisible or odourless gas (can't remember which) that can give you brain damage.

This is obviously a very scary prospect, so I'd like to know if I need to be concerned or see someone, and also if I destroyed the washing machine.

1. My main source of exposure was a bucket of water, bleach and dish detergent with the ingredients and ratios above in this post. My face was around 0.5 metres/a couple of feet away for maybe a couple of minutes and I was turned away from it for half of this time, but I was also in the same room within a few metres/less than 10 feet of the bucket for around 10-15 minutes maximum. 

2. I also sprayed some diluted vinegar and water on some diluted water+bleach+dish detergent solution that leaked on the floor and then left the room very quickly after that.

3. The washing machine had dish detergent, a small amount of bleach and a small amount of standard laundry powder. It did a long hot cycle, and after that was done I've since gone back into the room with a towel over my mouth and started a long cold rinse cycle, but didn't look inside or open the machine, then left immediately.

&amp;#x200B;

During all this, I didn't notice any intense fumes other than a sort of chlorine-ish smell (I just looked it up and apparently bleach and chlorine smell somewhat similar), my eyes didn't sting, my lungs/chest may have burnt slightly after the fact but I may just be stressing/panicking. I can breathe deeply with no issues right now.

chemistry,"A bit surprised this evening by what I found on some copper I precipitated, hoping someone can explain.

Been synthesizing copper oxychloride as follows:

CuO into HCl until all reaction ceases and unreacted CuO accumulates in beaker. Decant. Dilute solution 4:1 with DH2O to give very blue CuCl2 solution. Add additional CuO and boil to form oxychloride. Decant/filter oxychloride/CuO mix and reserve remaining CuO solution. Decant/filter after a few days to recover tiny bit of remaining oxychloride that has settled.

Synthesizing 200g of oxychloride has left me with about 2L of excess CuCl2 solution. Not wanting to pour it down the drain I took 1L of it and added an excess of aluminum foil. After stirring and sitting overnight, I had +/- 100 g of copper metal and a few small pieces of Al in a clear, colorless AlCl3 solution. Stirred again and left another day, no more Al reacted.

Filtered off the copper in a buchner funnel and discarded the AlCl3 solution. Left the copper to drain/dry overnight. Came home this evening to [this.](https://i.imgur.com/KDirApr.jpg)

I'm not a chemist. Just a cosmetic enthusiast and I LOVE using saponins to wash my hair. I use yucca root powder, soapnut powder or garbanzo water for shampoo.

I am a beekeeper. I am planning to use oxalic acid to treat my hives for varroa mites. This is standard practice in the beekeeping community.

The traditional method involves placing a gram of pure oxalic acid crystals on a hot metal plate and inserting the plate into the hive. The heat sublimates the crystals to their gaseous phase, and the gaseous oxalic acid crystallizes on the bees.

This process is tried and true, but involves the use of a car battery and a hot metal plate. There are risks.

I’ve seen an insect “fogger” that claims to produce similar results. A small propane heated tube heats a solution of 15g oxalic acid dissolved in 100ml of ethanol, producing a fog that is purported to produce the same crystallization on the bees for mite treatment.

My question is: how hot would the gas in the propane fogger need to be to achieve this fog effect? Beekeepers seem to be skeptical of this technology because it can’t get as hot as the metal plate that sublimates the oxalic acid in the vaporization method, but I know that dissolution of a crystal into a liquid solution would probably lower the energy needed to get it into a gas.

chemistry," **Votre shampoing solide respecte-t-il votre cuir chevelu?** 

Lorsque nous nous lavons les cheveux avec un shampoing solide, nous lavons également notre cuir chevelu. Il est important que le shampoing solide utilisé respecte le manteau protecteur du cuir chevelu.

Comment respecter le cuir chevelu? Il est important d’utiliser un shampoing solide ayant le même pH que notre cuir chevelu, c’est-à-dire un pH inférieur à 5,5 ([*D'Souza &amp; Rathi, 2015*](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4458934/)*,* [*Gavazzoni Dias, de Almeida, Cecato, Adriano, &amp; Pichler, 2014*](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4158629/#ref16)).

En ce qui concerne les cheveux, ils sont chargés négativement. Il est recommandé d’avoir un point isoionique pour les cheveux lors du lavage avec un shampoing solide. Et ce point isoionique est atteint à une valeur de pH de 5,5 ([*Robbins 2002*](https://www.springer.com/gp/book/9783642256103)).

Si nous voulons respecter le cuir chevelu et les cheveux, il est recommandé que le shampoing solide ait un pH compris entre 4,5 et 5,5, selon des dermatologues et des études scientifiques. Le pH du shampoing solide peut varier légèrement en fonction du traitement des cheveux et du type de cheveux. Par exemple, il est idéal d'avoir un pH de 4,5 pour les cheveux colorés et les valeurs de pH doivent être ajustées en fonction de l'étendue des dommages causés aux cheveux par l'environnement et d'autres conditions.

 **Comment choisir un shampoing solide?**

Les shampoings solides sont économiques et écologiques, ce qui constitue une bonne alternative aux shampoings liquides.

Voici les 3 recommandations pour choisir le meilleur shampoing solide pour vos cheveux:

1. Recherchez la gamme de produits proposée par la marque et vérifiez s’il existe différents produits pour différents types de cheveux. Évitez les shampoings solides génériques. Par exemple, un produit pour tous les types de cheveux

2. Consultez la liste des ingrédients INCI. Si vous identifiez des ingrédients nocifs à partir de la liste des ingrédients, il est préférable d'éviter. Par exemple, ce site Web donne une bonne critique des ingrédients: [https://www.cir-safety.org/ingredients](https://www.cir-safety.org/ingredients). De plus, si vous avez un smartphone, vous pouvez utiliser ces 3 applications pour vérifier les ingrédients. [Yuka](https://yuka.io/en/), [Beauté INCI](https://incibeauty.com/), [Quel cosmétique](https://www.quechoisir.org/application-mobile-quelcosmetic-n52804/).

3. Vérifier la valeur du pH du shampoing solide en regardant l'emballage si cela est mentionné ou sur le site de la marque. Si le pH de 5,5 est mentionné quelque part, c'est mieux. Cependant, on parle parfois de pH neutre ou de pH équilibré, ce qui peut être trompeur, car pH neutre signifie parfois 7 ou 5,5. Par exemple, évitez les shampoings solides saponifiés, dont le pH est si élevé et qui assécheront vos cheveux et pourraient provoquer des pellicules.

 **Discussion**

Jusqu'à présent, il n'y a pas de règles pour mentionner la valeur du pH du produit cosmétique, il n'est donc pas facile pour le consommateur de la vérifier. Nous pensons parfois que les produits contenant des ingrédients naturels sont toujours bons, mais après avoir lu ce blog, vous auriez remarqué que les ingrédients naturels ne suffisent pas.

En ce qui concerne les shampoings liquides, de nombreux produits au Brésil et en Inde ont un pH supérieur à 5,5 selon [*Gavazzoni Dias, de Almeida, Cecato, Adriano, &amp; Pichler, 2014*](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4158629/#ref16) et [*Tarun, Susan, Suria, Susan, &amp; Criton, 2014*](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4171909/)*.*

Aucune donnée publiée n'est disponible en France et en Europe. Cependant, il existe des rapports de données non publiés qui indiquent qu'il existe également des shampoings dont le pH est supérieur à 5,5. Pour les shampoings solides, il n'y a pas de données disponibles concernant la valeur du pH. C'est parce qu'il n'y a pas beaucoup de marques qui fabriquent des shampoings solides. Cependant, après avoir fait une recherche sur Google, une seule marque, comme avant, affirme avoir un pH de 6,5 pour son shampoing solide au rhassoul. Des marques connus comme Lush et Lamazuna ne mentionnent rien au pH de leurs shampoings solides.

Par ailleurs, il existe de nombreuses recettes de shampoing solide maison disponibles en ligne, qui se concentrent principalement sur des tensioactifs tels que le SCI (sodium cocoyl iséthionate), le SLMI (Sodium Lauroyl Methyl Isethionate) et des ingrédients naturels. La plupart des recettes maison de shampoings solides ne parlent pas du pH, mais très peu de blogs parlent de l'ajustement du pH. Néanmoins, il n'y a pas de moyen fiable pour ajuster le pH à la maison avec précision.

I'm trying to get a list of electrostatic potentials at specific 3-D coordinates (so basically a table with values in 4 dimensions: x, y, z, and V). One of the files generated is called step2\_pbeq.out, and it has a table like this, but only the x and V values vary while y and z remain fixed.  Also, only step2\_pbeq.pdb and step2\_pbeq.dx are necessary to view a graphical representation of the electrostatic potential surface in PyMOL, so I feel like what I'm looking for must be in one or both of those files. But the former is just a pdb file (with some unlabeled value in the B-factor column) and the latter is just a grid of x, y, and z-coordinates (no fourth value) that I'm assuming is used to define a grid when calculating the electrostatic potential at the protein's surface. 

Any links/advice/insight would be very much appreciated.

Thanks,

chemistry,"I apologize because this is a very ignorant question. It's also a bit crude. Apologies if it doesn't fit here. I'll probably post it to plumbing and/or housecleaning subreddits as well.

Anyway, let me explain.

I had a clog in my plumbing, which caused my shower drain to flood the shower with sewage when I did my laundry.

I attempted to resolve this situation by pouring Drano in my kitchen sink. It made that sink drain faster but it looks as if there is a much more significant clog deeper in the plumbing of my home. I also decided not to use more Drano because I hear it's actually a terrible product.

Anyway, the clog has also made the toilet unusable. I attempted to shovel the shit from the shower into the toilet and flush the toilet, but this caused the shit to bubble right back up again through the shower drain.

This put me in a situation where I cannot pee in the only toilet in my home.

It is 22°F outside.

So I peed in my sink.

And then it occurred to me that urine can change into ammonia under some circumstances, and I don't understand those circumstances exactly; and that ammonia may interact with Drano in a dangerous way.

So I went to Google for help, and Google was about as helpful as you would expect. I have found random web sites on the Internet which reference possibilities like explosion or poison gas. The credible web sites use chemistry terms I am unfamiliar with, and the not-credible web sites are not credible.

I live alone with a small dog. I do not want to die, or to cause my little dog to die, because I peed in the wrong place. Although frankly, if you were to ask people who knew me what the most likely cause of an early death for me would be, the answer would certainly be putting my dick somewhere I shouldn't.

Seriously though — should I get out of the house? Is there any real risk of explosion or poison gas?","Have I put my life in danger by using Drano to unclog a sink, and then peeing in it?",1576639955

I have a mixture of two fatty acids prepared from a biological source (veg. oil). It's a waxy, oily slurry at 4 deg. so there are probably some minor contaminants. I can determine their mass-ratio using GC/MS. I'd like to empirically determine the partition coefficients for both FA's. They're predicted logP's are 6.01 and 6.33 (from ChemDraw).

My question is this: if I measure out a given mass of sample (like 1 g or something), and know the ratio of the two, can I accurately measure the partitioning of the two between aqueous and organic phases?

My lab has an instrument that is gaining popularity so that in the next few months, we can expect maybe around 4-5 different groups to be using it. Let's assume that money and personalities won't be a problem (dream land). Do you know any good tools we could use to make reservations of the instrument easy?

Everyone in the user group would ideally be able to see the maintenance tasks and measurement tasks on a schedule/calendar view.

My organization has Microsoft Teams so I was considering setting up a MS Team with a planner tab, where people can enter their tasks under a ""Measurement"" or ""Maintenance"" bucket and assign it to themselves or others in the group, and set a date.

I wanted to consider other tools because my method isn't the smoothest for setting specific times, and plus the calendar view isn't the default view of the planner tab.

I'd also like to welcome anyone's horror or happy stories about shared instruments so that I can learn from them. I know at my old university, my group was badly known for monopolizing certain instruments all day every day, so I want to set ours up off the bat so that no one can monopolize it (not sure of a good way yet).

As the title suggests, I'm working on developing [an app](https://www.avidnote.com), together with some friends, that is meant to make the process of taking notes easier when reading/writing research papers. I'm looking for beta testers for our closed beta.

The main functionality includes:

* ability to read and comment on a paper simultaneously by having the document that you're reading on one side and your notes on the other. The user would be able to highlight text and write corresponding notes in the note taker and have these two be linked. This is meant to mimic the act of jotting down notes on a physical paper in the margins. Support for LaTex.

* easily searchable and organized online. This is one of the main drawbacks that I had with using physical paper to take notes, it's easy to misplace and you can't really search your notes.

* quicker note taking with templates. These templates include specifically formatted notes that you can create on the fly depending on the need, e.g. notes for research papers, lab notes, interview notes (for qualitative research) and so forth.

* encrypted and safe storage. 

* later version could include third party integration with Mendeley &amp; Zotero for references and Dropbox/Box for external storage. The initial app is expected to feature a simple backup function where you can download all of your notes. The user would be able to remove notes completely, since I know that is a requirement for certain researchers with sensitive data.

I would also be interested in potential solubility limits. I've seen reports of people achieving up to 200 mg/mL solutions, but others stating that they made 50 mg/mL.

I have read from Sigma that

&gt;NAD is soluble in water at 50 mg/mL, and that an aqueous solution may be made by adjusting the pH using NaOH or a sodium bicarbonate buffer.

Does this not imply that a carbonate buffer would be usable? They then also state that

&gt;As per external source information β-NAD is soluble in PBS pH 7.2 at 10mg/ml.

This to me implies that a phosphate buffer would be suitable. However, they finally said the following:

&gt;Aqueous solutions between pH 2 - 6, stored as single-use aliquots at -70 °C, are stable for at least 6 months. Neutral or slightly acidic solutions are stable at 0 °C for at least 2 weeks. Solutions are rapidly degraded upon heating and are very labile in alkaline solutions, **especially in the presence of phosphate, maleate, or carbonate.**

If you need salicylic acid and not acetylsalicylic acid, you dont need to remove fillers before the acid/base ester hydrolysis step. just dissolve the tablets in the hot water w/ the acid and base, do the reflux, then filter the still-hot salicylic acid solution through a buchner funnel that has been preheated with hot water.",Idea for making salicylic acid directly from aspirin pills without wasting so much acetone (please do not read this post if you hate home chemistry and think it's a dumb hobby for fools that will have the DEA breaking down your door),1574825229

**How Boric Acid Kills Cockroaches**

If you’ve ever had to call a professional to deal with a cockroach problem, you have probably heard of boric acid. The word “acid” may throw some people off, as a warning to not use it around pets and family members. It is not as toxic as its name suggests and is one of the more efficient and safe cockroach elimination methods available when applied correctly.

What is Boric Acid?

Boric acid is a combination of water and boron, which takes the form of powder. Boric acid is a naturally-occurring compound found in fruits and plants. While this mix is highly toxic to cockroaches, it is relatively harmless to humans and pets. You can make boric acid yourself or buy it from local stores and even Amazon.com.

The most prominent drawback to boric acid is that, when misapplied, its effectiveness is greatly diminished and can result in a mess. The powder is best applied to an area where cockroaches are likely to walk through it. Don’t use too much boric powder in one place, as cockroaches will avoid it if they see it. Remember: you’re trying to trick them into walking through it.

How Does It Kill Cockroaches?

When cockroaches crawl through the boric acid powder, it gets all over them, sticking to their legs, arms, etc. When the cockroach preens itself (cleans itself), it ingests the powder. If the cockroach doesn’t clean itself, its body will naturally absorb the powder anyway. Once the acid is inside the cockroach, it makes its way into the nervous and digestive systems, causing death shortly after ingestion.

Boric acid is considered so effective because cockroaches eat other dead cockroaches. As most of us are aware, cockroaches are not picky about what they do and do not each, going so far as to eat other cockroaches if they’re dead. After the cockroaches eat the one that died from the boric acid, the acid gets into their system, and the cycle continues.

You can also sprinkle boric acid on bait or traps, working in combination with each other. The powder clings to the food, and the cockroaches bring it back to their nest and all feed on it. Naturally, this allows ingestion of the acid through multiple cockroaches that will eventually die and be eaten, so on and so forth.

Mistake #1: Too Much Boric Acid

The biggest mistake that many make when they use boric acid is applying too much of it. If a roach walks into a wall of boric acid, what do you think it will do? It certainly won’t waste the effort to climb over it when walking around it makes more sense.

A little goes a long way here, so dust a very thin layer. An almost invisible layer is what you should be shooting for. You want to use just enough so that you can barely see the layer of boric acid with your naked eyes. To be honest, to get this perfect, you’ll need a decent bulb duster.

If you’re using the commonly found squeeze bottles, make sure the opening for the cap is small. Cover the opening with your finger, give the bottle a good shake or two and then quickly squeeze out a thin layer onto the area. You’ll have to do this every time you need to apply the dust. It’s a hassle, but if don’t have a bulb duster, you will need to do this frequently or you’ll be wasting your time.

Mistake #2: Applying the Powder in the Wrong Places

Just as important is where you apply the powder. Applying it in areas where roaches do not frequent, or away from where they’re living is ineffective.

Mistake #3 – Limiting Your Success Rate

When people hear about how great boric acid is, they get tunnel vision and make the mistake of thinking that’s all they should use. It’s good that you’re putting in the effort to learn how to use boric acid properly, but don’t limit your success rate. What do I mean by that? Simply put, don’t use just boric acid alone

chemistry,"I'm having trouble really getting a grasp on the physical aspects of a miscibility gap. I understand the thermodynamics of it and superficially what's going on, but beyond that, I'm not really too sure. I can give a solid answer to what the composition is of each of the liquids that end up separating within that miscibility gap at equilibrium, but what happens when you decide to boil the mixture? Say you have an open at the top system of two liquids and the more volatile fluid is the lighter one. You start with a mixture at a certain set composition below the miscibility gap, and heat the mixture until it phase separates resulting in two phases with a light and heavy phase, with each one very rich in a single component. If you decide to heat this mixture to the boiling temperature of the lighter phase, which in this case is more volatile, would only that component boil off? If it does, then as the liquid level of the lighter phase approaches the interface, since the overall mixture is lessening in composition of one of its constituents, if it decreases further than the composition in which it phase separates while still at this temperature, will the mixture return to being miscible and in a single phase?

Correct me if I'm wrong, as this is just me spitting out and exploring some guesses as to what's happening in this situation! As you leave the miscibility gap composition, then the system will try to go back to equilibrium, but this will be limited by how quickly each component can diffuse into each other. However, this idea weirds me out since I always thought the driving force of diffusion is a difference in concentration in space. Even though the lighter phase component is lessening as you boil it off, the local concentrations of each component at the interface should remain the same until the level of the lighter fluid reaches the interface. And, since the two liquids have phase separated into two immiscible phases, they probably aren't really diffusing into each other to a large extent and are being held to their respective phase by surface tension or something (I'm guessing). If this is the case, would it be correct to say that you could effectively boil off the lighter fluid and achieve a relatively pure heavy phase? I know that at this point LLE diagrams don't really help you with visualizing the behavior of transient systems since you're no longer at equilibrium, but darn if it isn't an interesting question imo.

Ultimately I'm just wondering the heck happens if you decide to boil off one of the phases of a binary liquid system that becomes miscible below a certain fraction of the component being boiled off.

chemistry,"The symptoms were stomach pain, vomiting, bloating, joint pain, muscle pain, nerve damage, fatigue, a bitter/metallic taste in the back of the mouth. My doctors found signs of chronic gastritis, but otherwise, everything was normal, and they were stumped. 

I initially suspected that the dexamethasone I'm taking for my autoimmune condition was the cause, because glucocorticoids and NSAIDs are known to cause stomach damage. Reading [the literature](https://www.physiology.org/doi/full/10.1152/physrev.00004.2008?url_ver=Z39.88-2003&amp;rfr_id=ori%3Arid%3Acrossref.org&amp;rfr_dat=cr_pub%3Dpubmed), I found that the mechanism is through impairment of the nitric oxide synthase cascade. Nitric oxide is normally produced in the stomach to protect it from oxidation damage caused by the peroxides generated during normal digestion. Indeed, I found that my stomach symptoms were not relieved by antacids, but were improved by antioxidants. The allicin in garlic is known to stimulate NO-synthase, and I found that eating absurd amounts of garlic did indeed relieve my symptoms. 

However, cutting my dexamethasone down to minimal levels did not resolve my symptoms. I started controlling for every single factor in my life, including diet, behavior, location, etc. I thought I had ruled out everything, including the water. Then, one night last week, I was brushing my teeth while thinking about what else could cause oxidative damage, and that's when it hit me. 

It was the fluoride. I was using a  prescription  high-fluoride (1.1% NaF)  toothpaste for sensitivity.

chemistry,"I’ve seen my fair share of these sorts of posts asking for guidance, and know they’re not necessarily always appreciated here. I’ll try and keep it short. 

—

I’m currently an undergraduate at one of the better research institutions in the United States. Ever since arriving, I thought I wanted to pursue chemistry; I took two semesters of organic chemistry and did okay, but fell short of getting an A both times. After that, I began doing research in a lab on campus, doing wet work and working on a paper that wasn’t necessarily within my interests, but still engaging nonetheless. 

This semester, my research began to pick up and I simultaneously enrolled in a graduate level organic chemistry class not typically taken by undergrads. I’ve been taking a full course load in addition to doing research, and I find myself spending upwards of 20 hours a week in lab.  I’m losing interest in the minutiae of my project, and a number of my reactions are highly sensitive to outside conditions. I can’t recall any reactions I’ve run in the past month that have gone fully to completion, and more than a few have outright failed, despite stringently treating my glassware each time. Progress on my project is slow, and it seems like my classes get in the way of me being able to productively engage in research. Meanwhile, my grades continue to suffer because I spend so much time in lab that I don’t have the chance to study adequately for everything.

Even with a couple of publications by the time I graduate with my bachelor’s, I don’t see any possibility of me getting into a pHd program. After an insane five days of midterm exams (in addition to other life events), I’m now looking at either a B or a B- in my graduate organic class. Regardless of the circumstances contributing to that grade, graduate programs will want to see that I was able to excel in my chemistry courses, and my grades don’t currently reflect that.

I’ve heard plenty of times in /r/chemistry that the only option for chemistry majors is to pursue a graduate degree. Otherwise, my job prospects will be limited to basic analytical QA and QC positions. I know I won’t be happy with something like that; I want something more. I’d love to work on pharmaceutical synthesis, but can’t see myself able to take the next step to get there.

All of this has lead me to start reconsidering where I want my life to go. It’s not too late for me to change majors, but I can’t think of anything that I wouldn’t hate doing. I could coast by with B’s and get a B.S. in chemistry, and spend the rest of my life doing QA work, but I would never get a chance to put to use any of the incredible synthetic reactions I’ve learned. I doubt my gpa will be much higher than a 3.5, and I feel as though that will shut a lot of doors for me. I suppose I could go to a smaller graduate program, but at that point I don’t even know if it would be worth it. \\

I’m not totally sure why I’m posting this— partly because I need guidance, partly because I need to vent, and partly I guess because I feel so isolated. Has anyone else been through a similar situation? Where are you now? How did you make a decision about what pathway to pursue? I would be incredibly appreciative of any advice you have to offer.

chemistry,"In general, the warmer a liquid, the more solute it can dissolve (there are some notable exceptions, which were discussed in one of my past posts here). However, I have also observed that increasing the temperature of a liquid can stimulate nucleation of dissolved gases. This is easy to see with carbonated water. Why does this happen? At higher temperatures, liquids should be able to dissolve more gaseous solutes rather than giving up existing ones. Is there a strange, bi-directional transformation going on within the liquid medium (as in equilibrium reactions) during which adding more energy allows the transformation to favor nucleating CO2 gas? I may not have an appropriate understanding of any of this and my observation may be ignoring some factors in the medium. I know nucleation can be triggered by adding substances like salt, sugar, or ice, or by striking the container (shock). But gentle heating provides neither a substrate nor a shock event.

The environmental issues of gasoline production and combustion are not new topics. The perfect and complete combustion of gasoline would result in the production of water and carbon dioxide alone, however this is not the case in current automobile motors. Gasoline has many hazardous biproducts due to incomplete combustion. Nitrogen oxides produced contribute to heightened levels of particulate matter, acid rain, and ozone levels on earths surface. Unburned Hydrocarbons (UHC’s) emitted by car engines not being perfect systems are released into the air and have adverse effects on a human body, even causing cancer in the case of the hydrocarbon Benzene. 

The production of Gasoline is a distillation of petroleum, or crude oil, which is a fossil fuel. So, the substance we use to power our cars every day is produced through the use and burning of fossil fuels, and results in many air pollutants being pumped out of our exhaust pipes into the atmosphere, including very high amounts of carbon dioxide, a greenhouse gas. Carbon Dioxide emissions from gasoline use each year pumped over 1.26 trillion kilograms of the gas into our atmosphere in the year of 2019. This all is a frighteningly hazardous chemical process that takes place through over 142 billion gallons of gas used in the United States during the year of 2019 (390 Million gallons a day). 

Companies have started to take note of this harmful backbone of the transportation industry and have come up with solutions that are just manifesting in our world today. Major manufacturers such as Honda, Hyundai, and Toyota have begun production of Fuel Cell Electric Vehicles (FCEV’s) for sale in the year of 2020. 

Cars that run off of Hydrogen fuel cells are much safer for our environment than gasoline powered automobiles *and* electric cars. High end electric cars take power from the grid, meaning that they still run off of the burning of coal and natural gas, solving no real problems. FCEV’s are different. The hydrogen fuel cells they run off of work by converting the chemical potential energy of hydrogen and oxygen atoms by combining the two, to produce electricity. This results in only heat and water as its biproducts! The newest hydrogen power cell technology shows promising ability to power cars in less than four minutes, yielding a driving distance of up to 300 miles!

With this new fuel cell technology, there are hopes to reduce the production and use of gasoline one car at a time!

chemistry,"**TL;DR**: I was a master's chemistry student at a certain university in one of the post-soviet countries - I don't specify for the sake of anonymity. I was considered the best student at my department, but my supervisor had a falling out with me which resulted in my expulsion. Now, I'm applying to US Ph.D. programs. My application is strong so I’m not worried about that. But how do I best explain this 2-year gap? Also, I have some other questions regarding this situation:   
1) How would you suggest I ensure that I avoid abusive supervisors? I know that the insanity described in a more detailed version below shouldn't happen in the US but I'm kind of paranoid about it now...   
2) Is it okay to obtain LORs from outside of my university?   
3) I’ve heard that LORs from unknown foreign researchers don’t matter, is that really so?

**More detailed version.** For my master's research, I chose the wrong lab group. I mean, I know that some people are psychologically incompatible but this was just downright insane! In my country, supervisors mostly leave supervising of their grad students to their postdocs. I don't know why but for some reason, they figured they could just treat me like trash. I’m introverted by nature and have mild social anxiety (self-diagnosed, so I can’t be sure – we don’t even have this term in my country). Perhaps, they sensed it and figured I wouldn’t retaliate – who knows. I won't bother you with details, because that would fit several volumes. To illustrate the situation I'll list several examples: 

1) They used me to clean up some derelict lab that the university had assigned to them. They considered it to be some kind of initiation for grad students. Other grad students mopped the floor a little and were allowed to work on their theses, whereas they made me continue with the cleanup (including washing tons of what looked like 100-year old glassware). Even when everything was perfectly clean, they struggled to find something similar for me to do instead of just allowing me to work. 

2) You'd think that after that, they would allow me to start working on my thesis but no. Instead, they allowed me to do their work: do various syntheses for them, translate their papers and e-mail correspondence for them (they don't know English), rectify particularly dangerous solvents for them (nobody else wanted to touch that sh\*t), interpret data for them etc. 99% of the time I spent in that lab (I was working 12 hours per day including summer vacations) I was doing their work. They published papers to which I had contributed without even acknowledging me in ‘Acknowledgements’. They didn't even say 'thank you'. Instead, they said I should be grateful to them that they allowed me to be useful to them. 

3) Naturally, master’s students don't get paid for all that in my country (they simply receive a stipend of 40$ per month for keeping their GPA above a certain level – no, I haven’t missed any zeros). Not that other master’s students were in the same situation though.

4) They literally forbade me to work on my thesis without their permission. 

5) Often, they would say some erroneous BS that even a high schooler would know to be wrong. The first time I corrected them automatically. They had a rage fit. I didn't correct them after that... 

6) Once, one of the postdocs supervising me told me to conduct a certain synthesis using a specific solvent. The dialogue went like this. 

I - me P - that postdoc 

P: Conduct this synthesis in solvent A.   
I: OK. \[solvent A wasn't a great choice for that synthesis but arguing would have caused him to have a rage fit\]

*After the reaction was set up and running.* 

P: Did you do what I told you to do?   
I: Yes, it’s done.   
P: Did you use solvent B, as I told you?   
I: But you told me to use solvent A.   
P: You’re a f\*cking idiot! I couldn’t have said that! \[It actually sounded more insulting in Russian, but it loses something in translation\]   
I: I’m positive you told me to use solvent A…  
 P: \[starting to have a rage fit\] Are you talking back to me?!   
I: What? No! It’s just that I’m positive you told me to use solvent A.   
P: So what if I did?! Why didn’t you ask me if I’m sure about using solvent A?!   
I: \[I didn’t answer that because I couldn’t tell him: ‘Because you’re a psycho who tends to have rage fits without any good reason and asking you if you’re sure about using solvent A would have triggered it!’\]

7) There were times when they made me clean other grad students’ – including those younger than me and my peers - glassware several days in a row (and told other grad students to just give me their dirty glassware to clean). I guess, they just wanted to humiliate me that way.

8) Something crazy happened almost every single day in that lab. I’m not going to describe it all – as I said, it would be enough to fill several volumes. But I think you get the idea.

For those wondering why I didn’t simply switch supervisors or file a complaint, I’ll explain: it doesn’t work like that in my country. Even if it was possible, it would have created additional problems (retaliation and the like). I simply hoped to publish my work (what I did in the remaining 1% of the time I spent in that lab), to get my MSc with honors and get out of that place. But they went out of their way to thwart me from publishing: they told me to wait for results of certain experiments from some other university that my samples had been sent to (it required some equipment my university didn’t have) – the results never came in 2 years! Each time I asked them about it they either laughed and told me not to bother them or just had rage fits. I guess, they never really sent my samples. On top of that, it turned out that some of my drafts had been slightly modified and published without mentioning me at all.

My supervisor knew all that – it didn’t matter to him. I had no choice but to start publishing my work right away – otherwise, they would simply steal it and all that suffering would have been for nothing. I published one paper as a single author because it was purely my work. My supervisor and his postdocs contributed nothing to it. They found out (I didn’t really hide it). They are friends with the faculty's administration, so I got expelled. Of course, before that, my supervisor and his postdocs had threatened to pull some strings so that I wouldn’t be accepted anywhere. They are barely known in my country – much less internationally. Since I’m not applying to my country’s Ph.D. programs it was rather funny to see them red-faced with anger threatening me…

After that, I collaborated with some people and published papers in much better journals than those lunatics (they published mostly in some crappy local journals).

I’m applying to US Ph.D. programs now. The problem is, if I don’t mention studying as a master’s student it will look as if I’m omitting something on purpose – and I have no intention of hiding anything! But if I explain the situation, it might look like I’m badmouthing my previous supervisor and university. What should I do? Perhaps, I should just write something laconic (e.g. ‘I have finished my MSc curriculum but left without an MSc degree due to corruption at that university’) and elaborate only if asked directly?

I am teaching an alternative process photography course this autumn but our facilities are unable to safely handle glacial acetic acid, which one of the processes I want to teach requires.

* Water 750 ml
* Copper chloride 10-30 g  (1-2 tablespoons)
* Glacial acetic acid 80-110 ml
* Water to make 1000 ml

Lately, with some samples, we've been having a precipitate forming in the sample solution.  I'm worried about this resulting in under reporting of the actual value of lead in a sample.

Some info about or test procedure:

\- The PVA dust wipe is dissolved in 3mL of conc. nitric acid and heat at approx 100 degrees celcius until only 1mL of the solution remains (this takes a few hours).

\- 1mL of 30% H2O2 is added to the solution and heated at 100 degrees for approx 10 min.

\- The solution is cooled to room temp and diluted to 10mL, and then analyzed using a FAAS.

The problem is that over time, a precipitate can begin to form in the solution.  When this happens, the amount of lead determined using the FAAS also decreases.  I believe that the precipitate is lead nitrate (I'm not sure what else it can be).

I kept wiping until the shirt came back clean so I hope I got it all off.

1. Is it likely that 70% IPA reacted with this dye and changed it (to something harmful) or was it just acting as a solvent? My limited understanding of this chemical is that it's typically non-reactive and I've used it to remove thermal paste from my CPU heat sink without any issues, and that's pretty delicate.
2. Is it likely that this dye is something that can be absorbed through my skin? These are items that come into contact with my hands for extended hours. I'm pretty sure IPA can be absorbed through skin and it has been established that it will remove this dye, so let's assume I use hand sanitizer and touch my mouse, will that cause this dye to be absorbed in as well (assuming any was left on it, I was pretty thorough but due to them being the same color I can't tell if there's any on it)?

I'm in my junior year as a chemistry major and I've been working in a synthetic organometallic chemistry lab for 1.5 years and have been recently facing a lot of conflicts with my research advisor. When I started in the lab, I was sort of the star student that my advisor favored and getting praised for successfully synthesizing my target compounds. Fast forward to this past June when I started my 10-week summer research fellowship with him and his attitude towards me has made a complete 180. I do more than the amount of work I am used to and all he does is berate me for ""not putting enough initiative"" and ""not being timely with any of my assignments,"" when I do exactly what he asks when he asks for it. I finished synthesizing and analyzing 3/4ths of all the compounds in my family of compounds and at the moment working on writing up a manuscript. This whole summer he's been yelling at me and I think it's from a place of trying to make me a better student but recently it's been feeling like an unhealthy work environment where I am scared to come into the lab because he'll yell. 

Just today he came into my lab and I was finishing up some proofreading for a draft of my manuscript and was going to email him after I was done and angerly asks why I haven't sent the draft of the manuscript and that my writing is useless if I don't send the draft to him. He then commented on my work ethic and said if I continue to not show initiative that he would withdraw my directed study/independent research project for the upcoming fall semester that I need to complete the ACS chemistry major at my school and kick me out of the research lab, but I've been doing everything he asks for my research project and get complete berated for it.

I apologize if I am overthinking this at all. Basically, I received an e-mail from a professor I am incredibly interested in doing undergraduate research with. He has been busy and slow to reply, but he mentioned it would be better to meet in person to discuss this further. 

I initially e-mailed him about volunteering, but he has also brought up the possibility for paid undergraduate research experience, and from the sounds of things, he may have me fill out paperwork for that as well if he is interested. 

Would I dress for a job interview for this kind of interaction, or is it fine to go casually in jeans and a t shirt?

chemistry,"Hi there,

I have limited experience/knowledge of borosilicate and ground glass apparatus and need some advice.  The crux of it is I'm having trouble fastening ground glass joints at high temperature, without metallic components and making them air tight.

The long winded explanation: have a borosilicate cylindrical cell about 2cm in diameter with two conical ground glass ports on the same side and axis - this cell sits inside a heating mantle that should average at 160'C, but since two curved ceramic plate heaters sit 3-4cm away from the cell, that space between the cell wall and the heater will have an increasing temperature differential, meaning the ports will be hotter than the cell wall. Furthermore the entire heating mantle sits inside a magnetic field which is quite sensitive to disturbances.  Not thin thermocouple wire sensitive, but definitely steel keck clip sensitive.

So, what I have are two boro tubes with ground glass ends that fit the cell, they will feed gas in and out of the cell, the cell will be floating in the centre unsupported.  Ideally I want to use joint grease to hermetically seal the ports and keck clips to remove any chance the cell will pop off once the gas is turned on.  Even though the pressure is only around 1-2 atm, any sudden exposure would be the death of the cell since it's full of Rubidium.

I can't use the grease because it will melt at those temperatures from what I understand and may contaminate the sample anyway, and for that same reason I can't use plastic keck clips, I also can't use PTFE keck clips since they're stainless steel encapsulated in PTFE which will disturb the magnetic field.

If it were up to me I would replace the cell for one with with a larger diameter and long side arms which exit the heating zone so this problem is entirely averted, but that's not an option at present.

Any advice would be great.  I'm stumped.

chemistry,"I answered a question on how to choose solvents for a reaction on another subreddit and it seemed like a useful resource, so I figured I would share it here for any budding organic chemists:

Is everything in the reaction that is supposed to be soluble in it, soluble in it? Check before hand. Its always a bummer when you guess wrong and half your starting material is floating around and you just keep diluting it.
Is it reactive? i.e. You don't want a protic solvent in a reaction with an acyl halide. Or acetone around NaOH. However you may want to use something like neat pyridine to push an acid forming reaction to completion.
Does it have an appropriate boiling point? Many reactions are run at the reflux temp of a solvent as a nice way to regulate temperature above RT. Or if you have something very volatile, it may evaporate overnight and you're left with half-reacted sludge. If its at low temp, you don't want it to freeze.
Does it assist in separation? Running a reaction in, say, DCM is often nice because you can just dump water in and extract out aqueous soluble byproducts. Or perhaps the product or side products are insoluble in the reaction solvent, in which case you can just filter after you're done. This one is always nice.
Give up and use DMF. Sure its a pain to remove (lots of water extractions, or dilute in water and filter) but its polar aprotic, and dissolves damn near every organic material and many inorganic salts to some extent, and has a high BP so it won't evaporate on you overnight. It also stinks so you can tell if you have some leftover without taking NMR.
These considerations become second nature after a few dozen reactions. Solubility and solvent choice is a complicated beast, it really ends up coming down to feel a lot, and plenty of experimentation even by experts. Some reactions just stubbornly won't work in a common solvent that fulfills all of these, but performs magically well in some obscure solvent like diglyme or dichlorobenzene. Then we get to wave our hands about pi-pi stacking stabilizing some transition state or some crap like that.","""How to choose reaction solvents""",1564599025

We have come across a paper (I will link later), which uses the 2nd derivative of Flory-Huggins equation to get the spinodal line. 

The problem is that the entropic part of the equation involves a parameter (N) which relates the size of polymer to the size of solvent. In the paper they claim to use the degree of polymerization which for the studied polymer should be ~4000 based on number avg molecular weight, however the value they use is 2.3. At first I thought to compare the molar volume of polymer/solvent since larger solvent molecule should also be accounted for, but I have no way of reasoning out how the authors came to get N=2.3. In a related paper by some of the same authors they use N=23 which still makes no sense. I have tried contacting the authors but they have not replied (which I am taking to be a big red flag). I have seen plenty of other papers which use large N for large molecular weight polymer. 

I just want to know if someone else with experience with FH theory could provide some insight into the means by which N is determined?

Hello again,

Another PhD contemplater here. I know I have it in me to successfully complete a Masters program but have uncertainties about going for the PhD. A sort of program like this is something that I think I would really enjoy but I could see how rare or competitive this type of opportunity could be. Also mentioning that your Masters program would have to be specific to the qualifications they are asking for, right? So if you didn't focus on what the specific PhD program was asking for during your Masters then you might have difficult with entering this type of PhD? I'm not saying I would tailor my studies for a specific opening like this because I know it'll surely be gone before I complete the Masters degree, but doesn't anyone know how often these type of PhD programs are offered? 

&amp;#x200B;

Also, relevant tangent here: I would love to not take out more loans for going back to school for the Masters degree. What are the options for this? Is there such a thing as being paid to study? I'm meaning like working in a lab and being paid for that work which is also part of your degree? I know I could TA/tutor, but much much rather get paid for the research that I would be working on.

chemistry,"Hey guys,

I`ve always wanted to learn chemistry, but never found the time for it. Lately School wasn`t so busy so I had more freetime than usual. So I`ve asked my chemistry-teacher for some advice and his tips were extremely helpful. I wont list them up here because I am sure there are plenty of good tips in this group and it wont be necessary. However one of his tips helped me the most: It is listening to calm music ( Lo-Fi, piano, etc...) while learning. This actually really surprised me, because I always thought that music distracts you from what you are trying to do, especially if it is something new or difficult. But I thought it might be worth giving it a try so i found a good Lo-Fi playlist and a good piano playlist on Spotify and I was surprised how easily I could work when I was listening to them. I figured that the Lo-Fi playlist worked out best for me because it is a little bit more energetic than piano, but this is only my personal opinion. I talked to my chemistry-teacher the following week, and he told me, that calm music helps you to be more focused and more creative, no matter what you do while listening to this music. So it`s not just the obvious things, like art or programming when music is useful, but it actually helped me to prepare for my exams too, because I could memorize things quicker.

And because all of you are interested in learning new skills, I thought this could be helpful to quite a lot of you.

chemistry,"How much of a solute does it take for a diffusion layer to form around a dissolving substance?   


My understanding is that a diffusion layer is formed because dissolved molecules surround a submerged substance, to the point where some area around the substance reaches saturation. In turn, this slows the rate of dissolution because the substance has to “wait” until dissolved molecules diffuse far enough that this layer makes “room” for new molecules to enter the diffusion layer.

chemistry,"I'm 19, about to start over my 2nd year in uni after skipping half of it due to a severe depression. I had my first internship two weeks ago, did some stuff in a DES (2:1 urea/ChCl) and it was fun. I've been working on an MD simulator for a year to the exact day and well out of boredom I actually simulated the DES and how the urea's carbonyl was pulling the chloride away from the choline weakening the electrostatic interraction with the ammonium effectilvely lowering the melting point.

Well the lab got impressed and contacted another lab (at which I met a PI to discuss the simulator) to apparently have me bridge them by working on the DES and learning how to perfect my simulator. I've been working harder than ever, every day I get back to this simulator to try and fix issues and improve it and the simulation results and everything actually.

But the pressure is high, I feel like they are resting too much on my shoulders. I feel like a fraud about to get exposed. I tried taking pride in my work and gain some confidence but I fear doing so will turn me into some bragging asshole. I'm afraid to talk about my work and achievements to friends because I fear they'd think I'm some bragging asshole.

The solution, as I see it, would be to take pride in my work, to aknowledge my achievements, but the simple thought of creating this thread is already triggering this fear of getting called out. I really don't know what to do.

For the past two days I barely did any work. Every time I open a source file I just stare blankly at the code thinking about how pathetic I am for getting stuck and not having the decency to give up and admit I'm trying to do something I can't. I sometimes delete everything and revert to the last working version because I have absolutely no will to fix additional issues that arise from adding code.

The few friends I have are busy working actual jobs so it's not like I have much else to do. I just wake up, work on the simulator, and go back to sleep. When I go to sleep the only thing I can think off is how I can fix the damn code. I am haunted by the control flow and how non-linear it is. I fear it may entangle into spaghetti again and need days of work to get linear again which happened once and absolutely wrecked me.

I don't want to get depressed again, I don't want to disappoint the lab I fell in love with, and I don't want to give up on my simulator.

I lost all self-worth after finally coming out to my parents as trans and this simulator is what built back that self worth, without it I am nothing but another teen chem student.

But I can also see why he did it wrong, the monograph doesn't give much direction.  I want to make sure I do this properly...

After working on a reaction today performed in Ethanol that achieves clean, full conversion within 2 hours, I began to recrystallize by very slowly adding water and dropping the temperature stepwise, which is an anti-solvent for this product.

All went perfectly until I reached about the 70/30 EtOH/Water mark; here, the once off-white crystals swirling around at 40 C conglomerated into a sticky glob.

Adding ethanol back in seems to help, but not nearly to the degree of returning my product to it’s beautiful crystalline form. What should I do?

I appreciate greatly any help.

Thanks!",My product switched from beautiful crystals to a reddish-black glob in solution.,1563400247
chemistry,"I writing a blog about leadership/management concepts. My current focus is human decision making. 

A lot of evidence out there seems to suggest that the majority of human choices aren’t truly free choices. I wouldn’t go far enough to say that “free will” isn’t real, but I think that in reality we likely only really exert true consciousness at certain moments. Most thought is being driven and pulled by various factors:
-chemical inclinations
-balanced levels of chemicals in the body
-genes
-experiences that activate the release of selected hormones which in turn either activate or don’t activate specific genes
-evolutionarily developed tendencies 
-etc 

My point is that truly conscious decision making only really happens between 5-25% of the time. 

I listened to the Radiolab episode about Lithium below: 
https://www.wnycstudios.org/story/lithium
On google podcasts under the episode Elements, its the first 15 minutes or so.. Love Radiolab!

They describe how lithium has been used to treat mental conditions such as bipolar, depression, and mania and that people with these conditions tend to have neurons that fire faster than most other people. They also describe how that in certain areas of Texas with natural deposits of lithium near water sources there appears to be a connected between lithium in water and  50-60% lower rates of suicide and lowered crime rates in those districts of Texas when compared to areas with no lithium in the water. 

Looking at this, you’re like holy shit... the balance of alkali metals in the brain is impacting human emotions and human decision making! 

Bipolar patients are often given between 300,000-600,000 mcg of lithium. In these areas of Texas, the water contained 70-170mcg of lithium per Liter of water. That’s just a fraction of the amount given to bipolar patients and yet somehow these areas are having decreased rates of suicide and crime. 

According to University of Michigan Medicine: 
“Lithium affects the flow of sodium through nerve and muscle cells in the body. Sodium affects excitation or mania. Lithium is used to treat the manic episodes of bipolar disorder (manic depression). Manic symptoms include hyperactivity, rushed speech, poor judgment, reduced need for sleep, aggression, and anger. Lithium also helps to prevent or lessen the intensity of manic episodes.” 

Additionally, through further research on the interweb, I found that there is also an association between excessive amounts of sodium in the brain and seizures. 

The video below explains how sodium and potassium play a role in neuron firing: 
https://youtu.be/oa6rvUJlg7o

My inkling is that higher than average sodium levels could result in more frequent neuron firing/over stimulation. Further, somehow lithium can play a role inhibiting the flow of sodium or perhaps because of it’s similar structure lithium is acting in sodium’s place around neurons.  

When comparing lithium and sodium, both have 1 electron out of steady state. But sodium is more likely to want to play with other molecules because it will take less energy for it’s free electron to bond with something else.. because that electron is in the third electron shell vice lithium having it’s free electron in the second election shell.. 

If lithium is acting in sodium’s place during neuron firing perhaps more activation charge would be need to build up in order to activate neuron firing... I don’t know! 

Can anybody explain how chemically or why the presence of lithium would inhibit the flow of sodium in neuron firing? 

Thank you for any help you can provide. I’ve been reading about this for a few weeks and can’t find an answer.

Kurt

So as the title states, right now I am doing TP analysis on water samples collected from freshwater streams that feed into a larger lake. They are from a rural/heavily farmed area.

Anyway, I am using the standard method of digestion + color reagent and run through the spec to compare on a standard curve. 

So, everything has been going great except for one of my sample sites. For this particular site, every time I put it on the hot plate for the digestion (after adding sulfuric acid &amp; ammonium persulfate) it turns from crystal clear to a light brown color almost immediately. This has held consistent through every replicate, and even for the next set of samples taken a week later. I am doing the color correction by subtracting the absorbance of the digested sample with no color reagent from the absorbance of the digested sample WITH the color reagent. With the correction I don’t think it will impact my data too horribly, but I’m just so stumped at what could be in the stream to be causing this color change.

Website claims (emphasis mine): 

&gt;The real name for Glycerin is Glycerol, identifying it for what it really is – an alcohol (-OL is the ending of alcohol group of chemical compounds). As any other alcohol, **Glycerin is a degreaser** – it absorbs lipids (oils), and removes them from your skin. Many people mistakenly think that because Glycerin has a sleek feel to it, it must be moisturizing. In fact, nothing could be further from the truth. The sleekness of Glycerin is a result of the length of the molecules. They are much longer than regular alcohol (rubbing alcohol, for example) and therefore feel differently. To explain how drying Glycerin really is let’s just mention that it has 3 groups OH, the degreasing groups, while rubbing alcohol only has 1 group OH. So, **Glycerin is much stronger than rubbing alcohol in its degreasing, drying action.**

chemistry,"I'm sure this is something that someone on here has struggled with but I'm trying to get a reverse micelle to self assemble in GROMACS. Does anyone have any nifty ideas for how to pack the molecules so that they will form into a single micelle relatively quickly?

The system is isooctane/AOT surfactant and water. I have a collaborator with a cluster but the majority of the project is taking place on my home computer so I'm really looking for anything that shaves time off of the simulation as I can't afford to do a 100 ns equilibration run. I'm not sure it matters but just in case, I'm using the SPC/E water model and OPLS-AA for the isooctane, AOT and counter-ions (with literature modifications for the sulfonate head group). As far as aggregation number, I'm using a literature value and while experimental methods haven't given an exact number, the number I'm using is at least within the right range given by experiment. 

I've been using Packmol but with really mixed results. Invariably, what's happening is that the water core of the micelle explodes outwards in the first few steps. Like total vacuum. The system is stable, though. The water will re-coalesce and the vacuum gets filled and the rest of the simulation runs like normal, but the explosion means that what I packed as a nice, pre-formed micelle turns into 4-5 mini-micelles spread throughout the box that really struggle to re-aggregate and is not a significant improvement on random packing of the molecules. Watching the ""explosion"" closely, I'm reasonably certain that it's not Coulombic repulsion of the ions as they actually stick to the AOT pretty well and don't participate in the ""explosion"". My best guess is that the random orientations of the water create really unfavorable interactions so the water is exploding outward to minimize these interactions. Only once they're far apart do they seem to want to re-orient and start to find each other again. If that mechanism is correct, then this phenomena would be specific to reverse micelles as opposed to standard micelles as the pbc boundary in a normal micelle should mean that any forces that would make the water want to explode outward would be mirrored and push the water back in, forcing reorientational motion rather than the translational motion I'm seeing.",Any MD experts with experience building micelles (or bilayers)?,1563293447

so I am slowly getting on with my biochemistry online course. Who knew pH could be such a tough cookie... One thing still eludes me.

Why then, at a pH lower than the pKa, there is a higher proportion of an acid in its undissociated state when there should be more protons floating around, therefore the concentration of the dissociated state should be higher? Wouldn't that mean that at low pHs the concentration of protons is actually lower? Or does pH simply mean the concentration of potential free protons, whether they are dissociated or not?

For some background, I work in a large chemical production facility and we make a wide range of chemicals &amp; herbicides. 

There is a significant amount of water released during on the the condensation reaction between the acid (2,4 D) and an alcohol. This water is collected in the receiver and is contaminated.

I am working on a solution to try reduce the amount in the water so we can use it for other processes.

I have worked on the solubility aspect, raising the pH and heating and allowing the solution to settle for a day or two. There is sludge that settles but the concentration of 2,4 D acid in the water is still high. 

Does anyone here have experience with solubility/crashing/precipitating stuff?

I am hoping to either tweak the process and spend more time getting the pH range so that more is crashed out of solution, but was also wondering if hardening the water (calcium and magnesium nitrate), would also decrease the solubility of 2,4 D in water (which is about 900 ppm max).

My goal is to create essential oil extracts using 99% isopropyl alcohol as a solvent. The problem is, I need to create a recapture system for the alcohol. At the very least, someway of preventing the alcohol from getting into the pump and contaminating the pump's oil lubricant.  


Here's how I plan on accomplishing it:  
I have 15 gallon vacuum chamber with an inlet and outlet ball valve. A vacuum pump that will create .8Pa ultimately, it clears 3.6 cubic feet of space per minute. I place 24-48oz alcohol solution into the vacuum chamber in large rectangular pyrex dish. The chamber would start at about 80-100 degrees F at a bit less than 1 atm. (I'm at 3,200' F elevation.) From the 100\* vacuum chamber, my hose runs into a half-gallon ball jar in the freezer, to the bottom of the ball jar. Then the gas would run exit out the top of the chamber and run to the vacuum pump via the final piece of hose. The pump sucks out the initial atmosphere of pressure found in the vacuum chamber. Then the isopropyl evaporates from the main chamber, then condenses in the much colder, still under vacuum jar in the freezer.  


My goal is to get all the alcohol out of the initial vacuum chamber, and hopefully keep the vast majority of it from hitting the vacuum pump at all.  


Any advice, concepts to look into, flaws, et. would be appreciated. Also, anyone know where I can find out the data for this propan-2-ol stuff condensing point under various temps/pressures?

This method works well with lead, copper, mercury and even iron(II), but I ran into problems with solutions of nickel and molybdenum, that is: these two formed sulfides that blackened the solutions, but the particles are too small for my filter paper to properly get rid of them, and they dispersed too well that it's no use waiting for them to settle down.

I'm worried thought because it specifically says it's not *classifiable* as a carcinogen which makes me believe that the long term health effects haven't really been studied. Most of what I found was stuff about how acute exposure in high amounts can lead to eye issues but just temporarily. It is an airway irritant and can cause damage, but I can't tell based on the ppm what that means in terms of my own exposure. 

As I was typing this post up I saw on one of the sheets that it said that repeated exposure can irritate the lungs and cause bronchitis in the long term. In the acute term it says that in higher exposures it can cause a buildup of fluid in the lungs and cause pulmonary edema and how that's a medical emergency. That's not a chronic thing right, like that's talking about not being able to breathe in the moment? I've had a chronic cough since starting this job (but rationally I think it is that I have a post-nasal drip, because it just seems to be a lot of mucous buildup in my nose/mouth area not my lungs really) and I'm super paranoid I either have lung cancer or bronchitis now. I've also noticed my chest feels pressure when I'm in a pool, whereas it didn't before. I know I get paranoid sometimes so I'm really just looking for reassurance from people who have regularly used this substance before for years, or who have had scares like this, or who can look up this chemical and reassure me about it. I don't have health insurance because I just graduated college and my parent's plan doesn't cover me. I can't afford to go to the doctor so I'm hoping that you guys can help me suss out this anxiety before I drop a ton of money on what might not be needed. Thank you!

**TL;DR: I've been working with triethylamine the past few summers and I'm worried about getting lung cancer or something awful from using it once or twice a week. It's a strong smelling substance that is an irritant to airways but I'm figuring since it smells so bad/strongly I'm not really exposing myself too much to it because I naturally avoid it. It is not classified as a carcinogen. I've developed somewhat of a phlegm cough thing but it could just be a post-nasal drip. I think I'm being paranoid, can't afford a doctor, and want reassurance about this from anyone who can educate me more about exposure or this chemical.**","Paranoia about triethylamine exposure, can you guys reassure me?",1562103224

chemistry,"Hello all,

I am a fairly experienced/knowledgeable pyrotechnics hobbyist, and like most of us I am in constant search of a good blue star formula. A deep blue composition is extremely hard to reliably produce, and this leads to much experimentation within the pyro community. I have lately taken to synthesizing/purchasing exotic copper salts in the hopes of discovering usefulness in something that others may have overlooked. 

A once-popular but now rare copper salt used in blue formulas is Paris Green aka copper acetoarsenate. It was/is used in blue formulas, typically in conjunction with potassium chlorate and an organic fuel/binder such as shellac or red gum. Paris Green is very expensive and toxic, but one half of the molecule (copper acetate) is fairly easy to synthesize.

I have produced about 20 grams of copper acetate in the following way:

* ~250ml of 5% acetic acid and roughly 20 grams of cupric oxide are added to an Erlenmeyer flask and heated in a hot water bath with frequent swirling for 15 minutes

* Once bubbles begin forming, the flask is left at room temperature for 12-14 hours, at which point the reaction has stopped

* The dark blue liquid is decanted off and reserved, and 250ml of fresh 5%acetic acid is added. The first steps are repeated and the liquid is decanted again.

* Excess CuO is discarded and the blue liquid is evaporated to form dark blue/green crystals, which are then dried in an oven at 200 deg F for 1-2 hours to make them anhydrous. Crystals are recovered and milled to a fine powder.

Now, preliminary tests with this copper acetate have been promising but also frustrating. When substituted into known-working formulas using ammonium perchlorate or potassium perchlorate, the burn rates are accelerated and the color is washed out. It appears to function as an additional oxidizer in compositions. Self-designed experimental formulas using AP and shellac or lactose as fuel produce a gorgeous blue at the base of the flame or when first lit, but the flames are too fierce once burning and the color is washed out - even with added chlorine donors such as parlon.

I am unable to find any published formulas using copper acetate, so I am considering substituting it into formulas calling for Paris Green as the next step in my experimentation. My concern, however, is that *all published Paris Green formulas call for potassium chlorate.*

The first thing that any pyro hobbyist learns is that you don't fuck around with chlorate. You never mix it with sulfur, and you never mix it with acids. I have several pounds of the stuff that stays locked in the magazine because I'm terrified of it. People claim that it's relatively safe with Paris Green because Paris Green is insoluble in water and therefore the acidity is unlikely to cause any issues.

Also, according to Dr. Shimizu (pyro god) on the topic of Paris Green: ""The material should not smell of acetic acid, however the acid does not decompose chlorates."" I don't want to rely on that claim, but that does make my ideas sound less dangerous.

I am considering doing some testing with chlorate and copper acetate, but here are my concerns/questions:

* I feel like these two chemicals should not be mixed. Copper acetate is water soluble and I made it with a weak acid. My understanding is that a copper acetate solution is a bit acidic as-is. Even if I keep the formula anhydrous and bind with anhydrous acetone, it will still pick up humidity from the air. 

* This is gonna make chlorine dioxide somehow, isn't it? This is stupid and I shouldn't do it, right?

Any advice would be appreciated. I take safety seriously and I will not combine these chemicals if there is even minimal risk of explosion, but I don't have enough chemistry knowledge to tell based on the paper data alone.","Safety concerns with pyrotechnic composition, please advise",1562101120

chemistry,"Hello,

&amp;#x200B;

I want to first apologize because I know how many posts about graduate school riddle this sub daily.  But I want some opinions from those of you that are out working as chemists.  

I graduated a little over a year ago with a Bachelor's in chemistry from a fairly prestigious university in my state.  I had a decent amount of undergraduate research.  However, my mom was diagnosed with cancer at the start of my sophomore year, which meant that I was not able to take advantage of summer interships because I wanted to spend more time with her while also working 2-3 jobs to help my dad out with the medical bills.  Therefore, because I knew I may not have sufficient lab experience upon graduation, I decided to come out of school and work 1-2 years then head back to get my Master's.  This would also have the added bonus of getting a feel for the job market and see what things I may be interested in studying for my Master's.  

Eventually, I landed a position as a Research Associate at a cGMP CDMO biopharmaceutical company.  I work primarily with UPLC-UV/MS instrumentation focusing on profiling, charaterization, etc. of primarily monoclonal antibodies, but at times work with large proteins, poly peptides, and other large biomolecules.  I am paid $45,000/yr with bonuses depending on our performance on various contracts.  We do everything from Method Development, Qualification, Validation, up to commercial testing.  I am the only individual on our 12 person team with a Bachelor's (2 Master's, 9 w/ PhD's).  I have been given a lot of responsibility and for certain projects I have been one of the go-to lab personnel due to my consistency.  Additionally, I am becoming one of the go-to individuals on the team for data analysis due to my attention to detail and speed of analysis.  (please don't take this as me bragging... I am just saying what has been said to me by my boss and superiors)

&amp;#x200B;

Now that I have gotten so involved in this position/company, I'm slightly confused what is the best course of action for the future.  I've been thinking of it as a 2-year plan.  I've spoken to my boss and he has told me that his goal is to get me up to a Scientist I position (\~$80,000/yr) and hopefully eventually a Sci II/Project Lead (\~$100,000+/yr) position, yet he gave no timetable and he could always be bluffing.  However, I would really like to go back to get my Master's at the least to expand my knowledge on an area and build my credentials (assuming I can work out a TA or some position to pay for it).  My boss was pretty honest about the fact that education credentials go a long way in this industry and can sometimes overshadow individuals with better work/more intelligence.  And he sat down with me for about an hours a couple weeks ago for me to ask him questions about graduate school/Master's/thesis, etc. from an employers viewpoint. 

So, what are the opinions about this from some of you all with more experience than I?  Would a Master's degree be a good thing for me to shoot for in the next two years (as in start in the next two years)?  If so, is a graduate degree truly as important and powerful as my boss says?  Should there be any rush on my end for starting my Master's, or would it be better to take my time so that I am sure what I want to go back for?  If I choose a certain discipline to study for my thesis (looking at Proteomics via Mass Spec), how much does it lock me into working jobs that are similar to my graduate studies?

I read in this document that organic amines, ammonia, and ammonium hydroxide are highly reactive towards secondary chlorine atoms on a polymeric backbone (chlorinated poly(vinyl chloride)):

This would cause de-chlorination of the polymer backbone, leading to deleterious unsaturation, oxidation, crosslinking effects that weaken the material.

We are told to reuse and not allowed to throw away these stuff unless they're broken or unusable: Pasteur pipettes, test tube &amp; vial septums, and even latex gloves.

The environmental issues of gasoline production and combustion are not new topics. The perfect and complete combustion of gasoline would result in the production of water and carbon dioxide alone, however this is not the case in current automobile motors. Gasoline has many hazardous biproducts due to incomplete combustion. Nitrogen oxides produced contribute to heightened levels of particulate matter, acid rain, and ozone levels on earths surface. Unburned Hydrocarbons (UHC’s) emitted by car engines not being perfect systems are released into the air and have adverse effects on a human body, even causing cancer in the case of the hydrocarbon Benzene. 

The production of Gasoline is a distillation of petroleum, or crude oil, which is a fossil fuel. So, the substance we use to power our cars every day is produced through the use and burning of fossil fuels, and results in many air pollutants being pumped out of our exhaust pipes into the atmosphere, including very high amounts of carbon dioxide, a greenhouse gas. Carbon Dioxide emissions from gasoline use each year pumped over 1.26 trillion kilograms of the gas into our atmosphere in the year of 2019. This all is a frighteningly hazardous chemical process that takes place through over 142 billion gallons of gas used in the United States during the year of 2019 (390 Million gallons a day). 

Companies have started to take note of this harmful backbone of the transportation industry and have come up with solutions that are just manifesting in our world today. Major manufacturers such as Honda, Hyundai, and Toyota have begun production of Fuel Cell Electric Vehicles (FCEV’s) for sale in the year of 2020. 

Cars that run off of Hydrogen fuel cells are much safer for our environment than gasoline powered automobiles *and* electric cars. High end electric cars take power from the grid, meaning that they still run off of the burning of coal and natural gas, solving no real problems. FCEV’s are different. The hydrogen fuel cells they run off of work by converting the chemical potential energy of hydrogen and oxygen atoms by combining the two, to produce electricity. This results in only heat and water as its biproducts! The newest hydrogen power cell technology shows promising ability to power cars in less than four minutes, yielding a driving distance of up to 300 miles!

With this new fuel cell technology, there are hopes to reduce the production and use of gasoline one car at a time!

The concentrations were determined using an atomic absorption spectroscope.

While this isn't an entirely correct way to compare the two visually it is clear that there is a difference between the two. There is a clear difference in the amount sodium, we were able to confirm that last week after our atomic emission spectroscope analyses and it can also be seen very clearly.

Say I had a solution of water and propylene glycol that contained a substance that I wanted to remove and isolate in its freebase form via acid/base extraction, using heptane (or any arbitrary nonpolar solvent) to remove the deprotonated compound of interest. Would there be phase separation there?

I have a complete understanding of acid/base extractions so that’s not really the issue. I’m just a bit confused because I know that water and propylene glycol are miscible, and I’m pretty sure that heptane and propylene glycol are also miscible, so I’m worried that if I even get any phase separation at all (after the addition of heptane to the propylene glycol/water solution in a sep funnel), I might contaminate my organic layer with propylene glycol which would be a pain to remove due to its high boiling point.

I guess maybe I could add base to the initial propylene glycol/water solution containing my protonated molecule of interest to crash out the freebase material, then add heptane to dissolve the freebase material and isolate the organic layer, then distill off the heptane and see if I’m left with a sticky mess of my compound of interest plus propylene glycol. If so, I guess I could add more organic solvent and then wash it with water a few times (the freebase material strongly favors the organic layer) to remove the propylene glycol and then concentrate my material again, but I’m not certain I’d be able to remove all of it this way.

I’m on mobile so I apologize for any formatting errors.

I am currently attempting to extract salicylin from willow bark and transform it into salicylic acid for my master project. As I understand it, it mostly requires knowledge in organic chemistry, and it seems like I've gotten the most out of my Ochem teacher as I can get! 

&amp;#x200B;

So far, I've tried several different ways, which have failed in different ways. Today, I managed to complete three different protocols, each very different, and some of the results leaves me even more confused than before.

My starting goal was extracting salicylin from willow bark, transforming it into saligenin, transforming saligenin into salicylic acid, and then creating acetylsalicylic acid (aspirin) with it. Because of the lack of results, I've refined my goal to simply extracting salicylin, and if every thing goes well, going to salicylic acid.

&amp;#x200B;

My teacher is slightly helpless, which makes everything even harder. Also, every protocol I've found on the internet so far has been incomplete, unclear or never tested before, so...

At the end of my chem class everyone in class (about 14 people) took all their samples (and there were a lot because we had to get new test tubes with the same chemicals for 4 sets of tests) and put it in the wash bin. I usually am the first in to clean because I kinda enjoy the simple task (weird I know) at the end of class and the smell crept up on me.

I think we were supposed to clean it under the hood because it started with a slight burning in my nose and a very small headache and then it got really bad like the inside of my nose was on fire and what felt like the first ever migraine I have had since last semester when someone carried around ammonia outside the hood. (This is the second migraine I have ever had in my life).

Thing is the professor never told us to clean it under the hood. He just tells us to dump what you can in the waste jug under the hood and throw the tubes in the wash bin.

And honestly I have never washed any tubes under the hood before, so I didn’t know it was thing until I went home and googled it, and now I feel dumb while still in pain.

I don’t ever get headaches(bedsides brainfreezes now and then), and never this bad.

I knew nothing figured they sell it for 2 dollars and kids can buy it cant hurt right. Well upon looking the bag over I noticed  you can add a cup to a gallon of water and drink it... I didn't have a gallon but I had a case of purified bottled water.  So I put a cup into one 16.9floz and bottle of water and it didn't disolve even half of the cup worth of Epsom salt, I didn't shake it I took two little sips it tasted bad decided against finishing it. I filled a clean bowl of cold water from the tap and put the bottle from earlier in, the rest of the salts disolve.  I stick my hands in instantly bubbles form densely on my hands. I move them around after a couple minutes and a BUNCH of yellow and black stringy stuff comes off my hands as soon as I move them.  As shocking as that was a few minutes later i started noticing bumps forming on my hands that produced small white rocks 1-2mm in size that dissolved in the water upon trying to skim them out. They were noticeably different then the bubbles. I managed to get one with tweazers set it aside noticed that my arms had light to dark brown when I took my hands out that seem to be formed from whatever the white rocks are. So I'm 10 minutes in I put my hands back in and as I sit there shirtless, I see them all over my arms popping out... ejected is a better word as they flew all over a 120sqft area . Then my upper back started doing it I could hear them hitting the wall and TV next to me. When all that craziness settled down after about 10 more minutes  I asked my sister what kind of witchcraft shed gotten me into and she couldn't relate to my experience as well I've found nothing online and other then searching pubchem for things magnisum sulfate reacts with... just about everything. I wasnt taking any medication    out of the 300 or so listed that ""react"" in what way I dont know as it doesn't say anything besides flushed skin rash itching and the rest of the side effects that I didn't feel. I took a shower and when I walked back into the room barefoot it felt like i was stepping on nails. I took a seat in a chair and noticed about 20 holes In my feet I assumed it was whatever the rocks are I shopvac'd th entire room so that I could get collect them out (there is 100+- 2mm and alot of little ones) i figured they made the holes on my feet but when I went to check using my hand wich feels better then before I put them in Epsom salt water so there is that, I set a single rock on my index finger and it instantly felt like an electricic shock as well it absorbed into my skin and made a hard spot so I didnt do that again at least it didn't make a hole. They're white but id say they're all smaller then the Epsom salt was 1 pound bag note the Epsom salt was not the granulated kind like sugar they were 2-3mm ""salts"". I still have some brown spots mop that I didn't have before this experience but they are fading. I've put my hands back in epsom salt water with no effect after a couple days.

chemistry,"Hi,

&amp;#x200B;

I'm based in the UK and living at home at the moment as I'm signed off sick from university. My sister is currently sitting GCSE Chemistry and her teacher is pretty appalling, my sister and a lot of her classmates are behind. My mother's enlisted me to get her up to speed as I have a GCSE and A-Level in the subject myself (albeit from a while ago!), as well as a hobbyist interest. As well as the theoretical revision, I want to demonstrate some of the reactions myself as my sister's class rarely does practical work. I already have some basic glassware like borosilicate beakers and measuring cylinders (I've dabbled in producing my own CBD-infused vape juice) but I don't have a huge amount of chemicals lying around. I'm going to list the things I want to demonstrate, if anybody could point out if there's anything particularly villainous that could get me into trouble if I order it online that would be much appreciated!

&amp;#x200B;

Demonstrations I want to do based on my sister's curriculum:

&amp;#x200B;

Alkali metal reactions with water: I'll dissolve a small amount of sodium metal (can be bought on eBay in 1.5-7g samples - obviously I'll use much less!) in distilled water to demonstrate how it vigorously reacts and use a pH indicator solution to show a base is formed. I'll do this outside so the hydrogen production isn't a problem.

&amp;#x200B;

Alkali metal reactions with acids: I'll react sodium metal with phosphoric acid (it's fairly cheap from hydroponics retailers). Again I'll use a pH indicator to show that the acid is neutralised. I figure if I do this in isopropanol (I have some 99% lying around) the sodium phosphate will precipitate out and demonstrate that a salt is formed.

&amp;#x200B;

Calorimetery: I figured I can bodge together a poor man's calorimeter with a thermometer and stuff I have lying around. As for the reaction I figure I can do a neutralisation with phosphoric acid and either the sodium hydroxide produced in the first reaction or sodium bicarbonate carbonate.

&amp;#x200B;

Titration: Might have to skip this one unless I can get a burette and its associated paraphernalia on the cheap, but I figure I can do another neutralisation reaction for this.

&amp;#x200B;

I'll have to read the rest of the curriculum to figure what else she needs to learn, this is mostly based on what I did years ago and a cursory read of the textbook my sister has. I'm guessing electrolysis will feature at some point (if I remember right we used sodium chloride solution and graphite rods when I did this but it's been quite a while). I know there's definitely redox stuff in there somewhere, my first thought was to do the Briggs–Rauscher oscillating reaction, while it's above GCSE level my old chemistry teacher showed it to us as it looks pretty amazing.

chemistry,"My lab works with a number of chemicals flagged as inhalation hazards. I’m looking for any advice on efficient ways to work with these + stay safe. Obviously keeping everything in the hood, moving the balance into the hood, weighing in a vial/syringe if not, etc. 

What has worked well for you? 

I find myself struggling with weighing out our internal standard for NMR (we use dinitrobenzene) - which is “fatal by inhalation” but also needs to be accurately weighed on a mg scale (microbalance isn’t going into the hood &amp; weighing a small amount into a relatively heavy vial is not that accurate). Some of my lab mates done care about the toxicity, others don’t worry about the accuracy. Any tips/tricks to do this well &amp; safely??

chemistry,"Hi guys,

Today, I had a weird discussion with my boss about pH that left me filled with doubt. From what I learned in school, pH is the potential in H3O+ ion concentration in a solution, right? To get this value on a scale, therefore the pH scale, you must calculate pH = -log[H+]. This would mean that a solution with a scale-value of 3 has a higher concentration in H+ than a solution with a scale value of 4.

My question is : am I correct to say that an acid  has actually an higher pH even though the number on the scale is lower? This would mean that the pH is high for an acid but low for an alcaline, and the opposite for pOH? 

Thank you very much for your help 😁",pH argument with my boss,1553014670

chemistry,"  
For my next project I need a lot of information about metathesis reactions, and the choices of related catalysts. Everywhere I search I find the following information:  


&gt;The Mo/W-system, mainly developed by Schrock, Hoveyda and their coworkers, is highly active to a broad range of substrates, but has limited tolerance to certain functional groups and has air and moisture sensitivity, making its use more limited. The Ru-system, mainly developed by Grubbs and his group, is less reactive than the Mo/W-system but is more tolerant to a variety of functional groups and is less air sensitive.   


The only thing I can't find is what are those MT reaction types, or substrates where Ru-based catalysts start to fail and you have to use Mo-based catalysts, sacrificing easy handling and process. If you know a comprehensive guide about this topic, it would be very very cool.

First tale:

&gt; for example plastic cuvettes
&gt; and it'd be best if everyone were given their cuvettes individually
&gt; and were responsible for them
&gt; so he took out
&gt; boxes full of cuvettes
&gt; opened them
&gt; poured them all into the trashcan
&gt; took the cuvette boxes
&gt; stepped on them
&gt; some cuvettes broke
&gt; put that into the trashcan as well
&gt; when he finished and went away
&gt; me and my labmate uh
&gt; recovered them
&gt; from the trashcan

Second tale:
&gt; One time
&gt; my labmate stole one of the random magnetic stir rods
&gt; next lab session he didn't attend because he was sick
&gt; but norbi was there
&gt; and was absolutely furious
&gt; WHY IS NOTHING AT ITS PROPER PLACE
&gt; WHERE IS THE STIRRING ROD

&gt; IT HAD A PROPER PLACE AND I CANT FIND IT

chemistry,"Hi,  


For context, I am a high school chemistry teacher.  


When I had started a few years ago, the school had an existing assignment where the burned various fuels (eg, Pentan-1-ol, Hexan-1-ol, Heptan-1-ol ..... up to biofuels with chain lengths of 16+) to investigate how carbon chain length effects fuel efficiency.  


Students compared these fuels by comparing energy output in kJ/mol and even CO2/mol  


Of course by using moles, they found that fuels with a higher chain length have a higher heat of combustion (kJ/mol) and gave of more CO2/mol... but this is an unfair comparison, as fuels with a higher molar mass are of course going to give off more CO2/mol and have more kJ/mol... as the molecules are simply larger and contain more carbon.  


I naturally encouraged the students to think deeply and converted kJ/mol into their specific energy (kJ/g) or energy density (kJ/mL) as this is a fair comparison that takes into consideration differences in molar mass..... I also encouraged them to use CO2/g (or even better, CO2/kJ) ..... however, I was reprimanded for doing this and have been told not to encourage students to think this way.

&amp;#x200B;

I don't want to mislead my students or encourage erroneous thinking, yet I also have to respect my superiors, even if they are wrong....  


My colleagues... for some reason... can't understand why kJ/g or kJ/mL is better, more accurate and fairer. Some seem to think that moles is better in every situation ""as chemists always convert to moles"" while others seems to think that it's situational - that in some real world/practical context kJ/mol is better and in others kJ/g is more appropriate....  


I of course, can't think of any practical context where kJ/mol is better.... Can you?  


How can I explain to them that kJ/mol is a misleading/less insightful in comparison to kJ/mass or kJ/volume?","How do I convince my colleagues that comparing fuels' energy efficiency in kJ/mol is invalid/unfair, while kJ/g or kJ/mL is fair/accurate?",1552531403

chemistry,"Hi all,

For a publication I have to explain why I chose to perform a UV-catalyzed reaction (365 nm) in 1,1,2,2-tetrachloroethane. 

The substrate is a polymer and is really only soluble in a handful of solvents. Other solvents would all be aromatic, for example benzene / toluene/ 1,2-dichlorobenzene etc. 

I was always under the assumption that aromatic solvents would be no good as they would absorb the UV radiation. For example, how reactions at 254nm UV cannot be performed in regular glass because it absorbs.

chemistry,"Hi all,

Had a good question today in my class and didn't think my answer was adequate enough so I wanted to reach out here to see what you all think.

As the understanding goes, for a weak acid, if you goto the halfway of the equivalence point during a titration, you are able to get pKa because [HA] = [A-]. 

We also know that the pH at the equivalence point for a WA &amp; SB titration should be over 7 because of the weak base which is left in solution.

If then, we take something that has a pKa of say 3, wouldn't we expect the EP to be lower than 7, something is counter intuitive here...",pKa = pH 1/2...for acids with pKa lower than 3.5?,1552450843
chemistry,"  Since Kp can only be changed by temperature, assume that temperature does not change and pressure is increased by decreasing the volume of the container.  This overall increase in pressure causes a shift to the product that produces less gaseous particles.

So does that mean the auditor will look through every single comment we have ever written since the last lab audit?

Also, when they look through our lab books what exactly are they looking at? Will they look in depth into the tests I've done, whether I've done them according to the method, what my results were?

Will they be looking at all of our lab books in the lab or do they just pick a random one or do they not look in our lab books at all unless necessary?

Similarly, will they go through the results on all the tests conducted on the active pharmaceutical ingredients/finished products and ensure they are within the accepted ranges? Do they pick random API/finished products to look into?

The traditional rose flower processing is obtained by the original heating and baking process. Due to the high heating temperature, the color of the flower buds becomes dark. In order to make the color bright, a few processing points are smoked by sulfur. In addition, due to the high heating temperature, the aroma of rose flowers is almost completely lost.

With the continuous development of vacuum freeze-drying technology, the application of freeze-drying machine in health foods, the dried biological activity of the rose active ingredient is minimally destroyed, the shape is well preserved, the nutrients and active substances of the rose are maintained, and the moisture content is low. High sugar content. The color is rosy, crystal clear, easy to transport and long-term storage.

   The method for preparing vacuum freeze-dried rose flower is characterized in that the steps include: a. rose picking; b. vacuum freeze drying: vacuuming to 15 kPa to 25 kPa, simultaneously starting refrigeration, and vacuum drying and drying in 2 to 4 hours. The temperature of the cold trap of the machine is reduced to -40 ° C \~ -65 ° C, the holding time is 0.5 \~ 2 hours; the rose is heated to 0 \~ 15 ° C within 9 \~ 30 hours, so that the rose flower is dry.",What are the applications of vacuum freeze dryer in health food?,1551862231

This is my first year of learning organic chemistry, so I'm no expert. The problem is that until now I've entered in a lab only three or four times, not for synthesys , but for titrations and other simple analytical experiment, so nothing complicated. I managed to get into a lab to finally do a synthesys, my first organic synthesys, in a bigger city than mine.
Ok, I'm in the lab, we discuss the experiment, alright, alright, understood, and theeen after pouring some reactants slowly, drop by drop, someone said ""pour""... and i poured the whole mass. Not sure if my verbs are really the right ones to describe, but I hope you'll understand.
What is important is that this pouring messed my whole reaction and lead to some secondary products. And I felt really bad for it.
And every other step since then almost made me cry, because I felt really bad for messing up the experiment, but I was really anxious and scared and when somebody told me to ""pour"" I poured =))) all of the other kids my age seemed to do waaay better and the teacher could tell that was almost my first time in a lab, even though I didn' t want to admit in front of the other kids.
I m really scared of studying chemistry now. I love it, I try to keep up as well as I can, but I'm scared of going to uni and having labs and messing everything up there. 

Is my first orgo lab experience that bad?... should I think about studying medicine instead of chemistry? And also, WILL I SUCK AT LAB WORK  F O R E V E R???

This is my first time posting here, so I hope I'm posting correctly! I'm currently attempting to optimize the synthesis of dopamine for a project I'm working on.

1) Weigh out LAH into a microwave vial and add THF, 0C

2) Dissolve nitrostyrene in THF and add dropwise while stirring

This did appear on our GC-MS graph, but not on our GC-FID graph, which is deemed more accurate. I have to write a lab report on it but I don't know what's the reasoning beside the absence. A few things we probably did wrong: 

1) One of my teammate spilled some of our fat sample, but if this was a reason, why only ALA that's gone? 

2) Lipid oxidation?

3) Conversion to another fatty acid? There's a high concentration of arachidic acid that we found that should not be there, but I cannot find the link anywhere.

I've had this whole amateur lab idea in my mind for quite a while, but I preferred waiting until my last undergrad times to set up one (for obvious reasons).

Now I'm finally feeling ready to set up one. I won't be running into legal issues as there is no law in France that could forbid/criminalize the practice of amateur chemistry or the possession of chemicals/labware. (except if you're actually in possession of illegal substances)

chemistry,"Okay, if any of you guys are even remotely familiar with chemistry, you probably know of the phenomenon that occurs when an atom is ""split,"" causing an atomic explosion. Now, when we say that the atom gets split, does that mean that the subatomic particles get split along with the atom, or does it mean one or more subatomic particles getting separated from the others? I don't know if I said that correctly, but I hope I did, and I look forward to getting an answer from one of you guys.

I can't help but say this as well (I just want to say it because I have no friends and no one listens to me), but the reason I asked this is because I have always wanted to build a machine that is able to extract a certain number of subatomic particles from other atoms and combine them into a separate atom with the right amount of protons and neutrons. If that's confusing let me explain it this way.

For example, the atomic number of gold is 79, meaning its nucleus contains 79 protons; no more, no less. Now, pretend that one atom over here has an atomic number of 50, which is the atomic number of tin, and one over there has an atomic number of 29. The machine would extract the 50 protons from the first one, and then extract the 29 protons from the other one and combine them into an individual nucleus with 79 protons. For the neutrons, the machine would do the same thing. It would then form a gold atom, and it would continue this process and make more gold atoms until there are enough to form the object that you want out of gold.

Now, one flaw that you might have noticed is the fact that the machine would have to extract protons and neutrons from other atoms to be able do this whole process. Does ""extracting"" a proton or a neutron (as I called it) count as ""splitting"" an atom? Would it cause an atomic explosion??? I don't really want to find out... lol","What EXACTLY Does It Mean To ""Split"" An Atom?",1550683101

I need your help in building a centrifuge on a budget.

The centrifuge is to be used to sediment mesoporous silica nanoparticles in solid cakes (something that can be handled). the quantity to be centrifuged at once is 1 liter (however I am ready to compromise for lower amounts upto 750 ml)

Here is the list of items I will be using 

* washing machine motor 120 watts, 1350 rpm

* Square steel tubing as the rotor ( hole in centre to accept the motors shaft)

* Steel bolts to hold the swinging buckets hanging onto the end of rotor steel tubing

* cast Aluminium swinging buckets with holes and slots cut to swing freely with the rotor in centre.

* steel Spacers to keep Aluminium buckets centered on the rotor.

* Plastic containers that sit snug inside the buckets

*  Heavy base to hold on to the motor


As you must have noticed, I am aiming to centrifuge around a liter of fluid on a centrifuge build with least machining and least cost.  Budget is $40 :(

I am about to start working on making this centrifuge, would like any inputs that will help me improve the design. Any kind of Opinions and criticism are also welcome.

Here are some of my concerns

* The motor rotates at 1350 rpm, is it enough to sediment silica? Can adding in more rotation time compensate for low rpm?

* I am using Square steel tubing, I will be trying to keep the length as short as possible, is there any other material/form that can be used to keep the strength and reducing the weight?

* The aluminium swinging buckets are made of 3 mm thick material. Will they be able to take the pull? Or should i replace aluminium with steel (will increase load)?

chemistry,"This is a conceptual question, and something I've struggled with since starting to work in analytical chemistry as a graduate student.

So I know Beers law states that the concentration of an analyte has a linear relationship to the absorbance at a given wavelength, with path length and molar absorptivity thrown in there as constants for a given instrument/cuvette and solvent/temp.  My basic question is: why isn't concentration related linearly to % Transmittance?

The basic case I'm imagining is the following:

% Transmittance for 0x amount of analyte =  100%
% Transmittance for 1x amount of analyte = 90%
% Transmittance for 2x amount of analyte = 80%
% Transmittance for 4x amount of analyte = 60%

, that if you double the amount of a given substance, you should also double the amount of light being absorbed by that substance. Or so the thinking goes in my head.

So if that were to be true, then concentration would be linear to %T, not Abs, where Abs = 2 - log10(%T), and %T = I/I0 * 100%.  Obviously, if you graph abs vs concentration, the majority of the time the points fall on a line, not a log curve.   If you graph %T vs concentration, it is non-linear.

chemistry,"  

Patent US 2012/0033775 1A  figure 7 reports the composition of a gas mixture before and after application of an electric arc. That patent claims transformation but did not apply mass balance and stoichiometry as proof. So here is what happens when one does.  Since nucleons are conserved in transmutation, the basis needs to be nucleons to account for transformation. Hence, ppm is multiplied by the number of nucleons in the element or compound (i.e MW). Then, the total ppm\* MW of the after sample needs to be adjusted on a percent basis to match the total ppm\*MW for the before sample with a few more nucleons added which come from the carbon electrodes. The difference in nucleons between the before and after samples is the change due to reactions (both chemical and nuclear). A mass balance is used to account for chemical change. A necessary assumption to complete the balance is to assign any unknown peaks and the perceived increase in argon. The relativistic states which cause the catalysis of fusion create dipoles between the nucleus and the electrons cloud. So, the unknowns are assigned in proportion to the distribution of nucleons of deuterium, oxygen and nitrogen in the before sample and are assigned as deuterium, oxygen and nitrogen. The chemical balance also determines the number of nucleons to add to the after sample to account for carbon from the electrodes. Once the chemical change is accounted by mass balance and subtracted, the remaining change is nuclear. Before solving the nuclear stoichiometry, the ppm\*MW numbers are divided by the respective MWs.  The stoichiometry is then solved in the usual way. There is a main cascade of reactions for which the stoichiometry solved as above is 2 0 + 14 D goes to 4 N + 4 H. A full report is in US patent application publication No. US 2018/0322974 A1 pub. date Nov. 8, 2018.

chemistry,"So I'm an undergraduate student who has worked in a medicinal chemistry/drug discovery laboratory for almost the past two years. The research seems very interesting and cool, especially since you're trying to find new drug candidates and synthesize them.

What I've noticed from my experience is that not much chemistry is being explored - it seems as if most of the time I'm doing the same reactions over and over again (i.e. Suzuki reaction, esterification) to make this library of compounds.

This seems a bit disappointing to me, since I find myself enjoying the chemistry aspect (understanding the mechanism of the reaction, stereochemistry, etc.) and wish that I was able to conduct other unique reactions. From what I've seen, the biological aspect seems to be the main focus, which includes finding a compound with great Ki values and shows selectivity.

[Structure of Benzalkonium Chloride](https://i.redd.it/8czsmyvyo0g21.png)

We test this active by means of titration.  We make up our sample in Chloroform and a Salt Buffer Solution (roughly equal parts).  We titrate using a titrant of Sodium Lauryl Sulfate as a titrant and Bromophenol Blue as a color indicator.

We have been fairly successful in titrating our finished product for a long time; however, we have always noticed the endpoint of the titration equating to a slightly lower percent Benzalkonium chloride than the theoretical value.  This phenomenon can be contributed to another raw material in our finished product, Cocamidopropyl betaine.  The Cocamidopropyl betaine is a component in the overall raw material Caltaine-C35; which contains 30-40% Cocamidopropyl betaine, between 5-10% Sodium Chloride, and other materials (mostly water).  Here is the SDS if that could serve any benefit: [https://docdro.id/0tsa0Ox](https://docdro.id/0tsa0Ox)

  

[Structure of Cocamidopropyl betaine](https://i.redd.it/4nnltbz0q0g21.png)

My understanding is that Cocamidopropyl betaine is a Zwitterion, which has both a cationic functional group (the quatenary amine region) and an anionic functional group (the carboxylate group).

&amp;#x200B;

In the past we have noticed the effects of the Cocamidopropyl betaine on the titration.  Typically a soap that is batched up to 0.120% Benzalkonium chloride will test via titration to be 0.114% active.  With our most recent batch of Cocamidopropyl betaine the effects are more drastic; translating a theoretical 0.120% Benzalkonium chloride to a titration equating to 0.100% active.

chemistry,"The book aimed to identify deterioration problems, repair and conservation needs of andesites on the walls of the Ankara Castle. Decay forms of walls were documented by visual examination. Samples taken from the surface of the weathered andesites were examined for their basic physical, mechanical compositional and minerological properties. The bulk density and total porosity were determined as basic physical properties. The mechanical properties were expressed as ultrasonic velocity and modulus of elasticity (Emod). Compositional and mineralogical properties were determined by optical microscopy and XRD analyses. Soluble salt content of the andesite samples was determined by spot tests of anions and electrical conductivity measurements. Findings were evaluated in terms of the long-term weathering behaviour of andesites under the effect of the prevailing climate, air pollution problems of Ankara, dampness problems of the structure, previous repairs with incompatible cement mortars. The surfaces of Ankara Castle andesite blocks were heavily weathered. The results were compared with the physical and mechanical properties of fresh andesites from Gölbaşı- Ankara quarry. The surface of the andesite blocks at the Ankara Castle, had low bulk density and high porosity, low ultrasonic velocity and low Emod values. Thin section and XRD analyses supported those results by revealing the presence of physical and chemical weathering on feldspars and other main minerals of andesite, as well as the presence of amorphous minerals at the surface.

Bu çalışmanın amacı Ankara andezitlerinin bozulma sorunlarını, bozulmuşluk durumlarını ortaya koymak, koruma çalışmalarının kapsamını belirlemektir. Çalışmada önce, örneklerin alındığı kale duvarlarında ve andezit taşlarında görülen bozulma türleri belirlenmiştir. Andezit taşlarının yüzeylerinden alınan örneklerin temel fiziksel özellikleri kapsamında birim hacim ağırlığı ve gözenekliliği, mekanik özellikleri kapsamında ise ultrasonik hız değerleri ve esneklik modülü (Emod) hesaplanmıştır. Çalışılan andezit örneklerin mineral bileşimleri ince kesitlerinin optik mikroskop ile incelenmesi ve XRD analizleri ile belirlenmeye çalışılmıştır.Örneklerin içerdiği çözünen tuzların miktarı elektriksel iletkenlik ölçümüyle ve tuzlara ait anyonların türü spot testleriyle belirlenmiştir. Sonuçlar, andezitlerin karasal iklim şartlarında ve Ankara’nın hava kirliliği sorunlarına bağlı olarak uzun sürede gösterdiği dayanıklılık özellikleri ve çimento içeren harçlarla yapılan yanlış onarımlar, kalenin ilgili bölümlerindeki drenaj ve nem sorunları sonucu ortaya çıkan bozulmalar açısından ve koruma çalışmalarının kapsamı açısından değerlendirilmiştir. Elde edilen fiziksel ve mekaniksel test sonuçları Ankara kalesi duvarlarından alınan andezit örneklerin yüzeylerinin çok bozulmuş olduğunu göstermiştir. Sonuçlar, Ankara

Gölbaşı yeni andezit örneklerinin fiziksel ve mekanik özellikleri ile karşılaştırılmıştır. Yüzey katmanlarının gözeneklilik değerlerinin yüksek ve birim hacim ağırlıklarının düşük olduğu, ultrasonik hız ve esneklik modülü (Emod) değerlerinin bozulmaya bağlı olarak azaldığı saptanmıştır. İnce kesit ve XRD analizleri de feldspar ve diğer ana minerallerdeki fiziksel ve kimyasal değişmeleri ortaya çıkarmış ve andezit yüzeylerinde amorf minerallerin oluştuğunu göstermiştir.

What does it mean by the second point that ""rate will be proportional to 1/t"". Firstly shouldnt it be the initial rate thats proportional to 1/t and I dont understand how that is relevant to answering the 2nd question. Also i dont understand how changing the volume would affect the amount of iodine being removed, shouldnt it be the concentration of thiosulphate ions that would remove the iodine from teh solution, not the volume?


Also why do we assume that the rate calculated from the color change is the initial rate? Do we just assume that the rate of the reaction is constant therefore 1/t is aproximately the initial rate. And does the longer the time period taken to identify color change of solution from colorless to blue/black results in less accurate inital rate value?

They will be running DPD, course grained MD and atomistic MD simulations of surfactant systems, probably looking at box sizes big enough to look at micelle formation (via DPD), and things like diffusion or clustering at the MD level. 

It seems that all this can be done on Gromacs on a GPU cluster so this seems fairly cheap compared to the cost of a conventional cluster with lots of CPUs? Is there any downside to just buying a GPU cluster? How much would a cluster cost to do these simulations in a timescale which is useful to a large company? I'm guessing $100 k would get a very good setup? What about $20 k?

**Step 1**) First you will grab your empty bottle of water(or soda pop) fill it up halfway with vinegar. Now put the shattered glass inside the bottle and leave it as it is for five minutes to let the acid from the vinegar do it’s magic!     




**Step 2**)After you have let it rest for 5 minutes, you can now put the 4 nails inside the bottle and put it aside to get onto the last step. You’re almost there!     



**Final Step**) Now grab your baking soda and your sheets of toilet paper and pick an end to place the baking soda in. Here you will do it as if you’re going to roll it like a cigarette and make sure it’ rolled in from both sides so none of it slips out from either side.      



Now with the hard part aside you can watch the magic begin. Put the rolled baking soda on top of the bottle but don’t let go yet. If you’re to let go make sure you have the bottle cap nearby to close it quickly! Now with all that said just watch the magic happen right before your eyes!

chemistry,"Hi everybody, 

I've long been fascinated by chemistry, and dabbled in the amateur side of things here and there. I have a slightly above basic understanding of organic chemistry. 

That being said, I had a bit of an interesting find recently. Cannabis has been recently legalized for recreational purposes in my country, and I've been helping some people process their legal harvests via ice water extraction. 

The process is simple enough; break up material, submerge in ice water and agitate to break off resinous trichomes,  then filter through silkscreens to collect the resin glands. The wastewater left over, however, is full of chlorophyll, fine particulate matter and any resinous particulate smaller than 25microns in size. 

Just for shits and giggles, I thought I'd use 'an easily accessible archaic method for the extraction of a common potent analgesic' on the chlorophyll/resin/particulate matter solution. 

I brought the pH up to 9 and not much happened, however, To my excitement, after raising the pH to 13.00 with Calcium Oxide, the solid organic material dropped to the bottom of the vessel, and a fine film of crystalline needles formed across the surface of the resulting solution. 

I'm in the process of doing two separate experiments on the solution right now, and hung up by legality issues on the third, but I'd like some input and brainstorming as to whats happening with my little experiment.

Sample 1 was decanted and allowed to stand in hopes large crystals might form. 

Sample 2 was neutralized with phosphoric acid and left to stand in order to drop out any insoluble calcium phosphate salts. Next step is evap and see what comes out. 

And Sample 3 I wanted to do a toluene wash, evap and wash the resulting product with acetone, but any ""extraction process utilizing industrial organic solvents"" is considered no buener where I'm at, so it's not looking too promising with that particular experiment.

Are there any (cannabis) chemists who might be able to tell me what the water insoluble crystalline solid I've stumbled across is most likely to be? The crystal shape is remarkably similar to that of some 99.99% pure CBD isolate I got a while back, but for all I know I might have just made weed soap.

The environmental issues of gasoline production and combustion are not new topics. The perfect and complete combustion of gasoline would result in the production of water and carbon dioxide alone, however this is not the case in current automobile motors. Gasoline has many hazardous biproducts due to incomplete combustion. Nitrogen oxides produced contribute to heightened levels of particulate matter, acid rain, and ozone levels on earths surface. Unburned Hydrocarbons (UHC’s) emitted by car engines not being perfect systems are released into the air and have adverse effects on a human body, even causing cancer in the case of the hydrocarbon Benzene. 

The production of Gasoline is a distillation of petroleum, or crude oil, which is a fossil fuel. So, the substance we use to power our cars every day is produced through the use and burning of fossil fuels, and results in many air pollutants being pumped out of our exhaust pipes into the atmosphere, including very high amounts of carbon dioxide, a greenhouse gas. Carbon Dioxide emissions from gasoline use each year pumped over 1.26 trillion kilograms of the gas into our atmosphere in the year of 2019. This all is a frighteningly hazardous chemical process that takes place through over 142 billion gallons of gas used in the United States during the year of 2019 (390 Million gallons a day). 

Companies have started to take note of this harmful backbone of the transportation industry and have come up with solutions that are just manifesting in our world today. Major manufacturers such as Honda, Hyundai, and Toyota have begun production of Fuel Cell Electric Vehicles (FCEV’s) for sale in the year of 2020. 

Cars that run off of Hydrogen fuel cells are much safer for our environment than gasoline powered automobiles *and* electric cars. High end electric cars take power from the grid, meaning that they still run off of the burning of coal and natural gas, solving no real problems. FCEV’s are different. The hydrogen fuel cells they run off of work by converting the chemical potential energy of hydrogen and oxygen atoms by combining the two, to produce electricity. This results in only heat and water as its biproducts! The newest hydrogen power cell technology shows promising ability to power cars in less than four minutes, yielding a driving distance of up to 300 miles!

With this new fuel cell technology, there are hopes to reduce the production and use of gasoline one car at a time!

"" When we talked about gasoline, the professor went through all kinds of info that I don't remember, but the main idea was that you should use the cheapest, lowest grade gasoline that works for your vehicle, and only use the higher grade gasolines if they are specifically recommended for the vehicle.  The reason was that even though a lot of people think that the higher grade gasolines are somehow better because they are more expensive, they are actually not better because they are too rich with ingredients that can eventually clog up the engine and other fuel delivery structures on the vehicle.  So...cheaper gas is better, which sounded great to me as a college student with very limited income!

- Designing quantum dots for photocatalytic/photoredox applications. Quantum dots have recently been highlighted for their ability to perform interesting transformations such as hydrogen evolution from water, and various organic transformations.

- Incorporation of quantum dots in photovoltaics. Quantum dots of certain heterostructure archetypes can increase the efficiency of solar cells.

I see that cGMP/cGLP experience is highly preferred when applying to research positions.

Understand the purpose of cGMP/cGLP, write a derivative for EVERYTHING (missed a deadline, sneezed), everything needs to be approved by the study director, everyone needs to have an appropriate level of competency AND experience AND education, everything needs to be validated constantly (machines and software need to be also be validated prior to use), employees cannot be obviously sick as it could contaminate the area/equipment/chemicals, what to do during a product recall/when a customer complains, what is the role of the QAU and the study director, keep a record of EVERYTHING FOREVER, be prepared for an audit, wear appropriate clothing/nothing that can fall off of you/tie up your hair if needed, practice aseptic procedures, DQ/IQ/OQ/PQ, method validation, you need to have vendor validation, and make sure you are following the protocol TO THE LETTER

I also wanted to know if there was anything I might have to specifically know that are a bit more complex/less obvious.

Although I do not have cGMP/cGLP experience, I have worked in an academic research lab for 2 years.

[See a print of the page here](https://i.stack.imgur.com/Yyx4K.png)

**S'** varies by an integer from **0** to $2S\_{a}$ and for every **S'** value **S** varies by an integer from $|S'-S\_{b}|$ to $S'+S\_{b}$ My main interest is the chapter 10.1.1 Copper(II) trinuclear species where Kahn states that we have Sa = Sb = ½ and that the relative energies of the states can be deduced from equation 10.1.6 (the book says 10.6 but it was probably a typo).

    E(1/2,1) = 0
    E(3/2,1) = -3J/2
    E(1/2,0) = -J + J’

Substituting the values for S and S’ I’m failing to get the same results of 0, -3J/2 and -J + J’ and I’m getting, instead, 0.625J - 1.0J′, -0.875J - 1.0J′, −0.375J.

I am a current AP Chemistry student, and my class recently began discussing gases. 

We established that the factors that gas pressure are: 

 \- Number of gas particles in a given volume

 \- Volume of the container

 \- Average speed of the gas particles

However, I am uncertain about whether or not element of the gas make a difference since elemental gas vary in terms of molar mass and particle size.

If there were two identical containers at the same temperature, for example, yet one contains 1 mol hydrogen while the other contains 1 mol chlorine, would both gases exert the same pressure because the number of gas particles is the same in both containers? Or would the hydrogen exert more pressure because it travels faster and makes more collisions with the walls of the container (same temperature or average kinetic energy means that the less massive hydrogen particles would travel much faster)? Or would the chlorine exert more pressure because the bigger and heavier particles make more stronger collisions?

I few things I couldn’t figure out is the difference in terms of human toxicity of glutaraldehyde (in Adacel) vs formaldehyde (both have it but Boostrix seem to have a lot more) as well as aluminum phosphate (in Adacel) vs aluminum hydroxide (in Boostrix).

Adacel also contains phenoxyethanol, while Boostrix contains polysorbate 80.

Any suggestion and clarification is much appreciated.

chemistry,"Hi, a junior here, and I have a pretty important question I've been debating for some time now.

Should I take AP Chem senior year(next year)? I'm currently at a lot of disadvantages which lead to all signs pointing to a fat 'NO'. Despite this, I'm still thinking about it. Here are the factors as to why most would say I shouldn't, and reasonably so...

1. I didn't take honors chemistry, just regulars. I had the opportunity to at the beginning of the year to do so, but I passed it up like a goofball. I didn’t realize that I’d like chemistry as much as I did at the time.
2. I took it sophomore year, so the information wouldn't be as fresh in my mind.
3. There’d be hardly anyone I know in the AP Chem classes, seeing as I’d be one of very few seniors taking it among the juniors. This is bad for me seeing as I’m a tad shy and would have a hard time asking my peers for help if necessary.
4. I’m not the most competent when it comes to labs, which makes up a big part of AP Chem(at our school, at least).

A lot of it is just my own nervous tendencies, but I won’t let that stop me. Here are some reasons why I think I might be able to pull through it...

1. There’s only one AP Chem teacher at our school. He’s funny, easy to talk to, and an excellent teacher. My oldest sister(now in her sophomore year at college), who had taken the class, says that he might even be better than some of her professors.
2. I may not be a very ambitious/driven person, but I certainly can be when it comes to things I really enjoy(like science!). Though most of regular chemistry was a breeze for me, there were a few times where I had gotten stuck, but I spent every moment of my free time looking up video tutorials, going through examples, doing practice problems and reviewing notes until I got it down to a T.
3. I’d gotten an A on every single chem test, save for one(an 88%). If it weren’t for some of the labs, I’d likely have ended with about a 98% in the class.
4. I’ve asked the teacher about it, and he told me that it would be quite a bit of catching up to do, but if I was willing to do the work for it, then I could probably do the class without too much trouble or difficulty.

I apologize for writing far too much for a short yes/no question, but I want to make sure that whoever might read this knows why I'm so torn as to why I should/shouldn't take it.

&amp;#x200B;

I've just started a PhD project, however the lab is in a very different state from when I was shown around as part of my interview. Now, I am having concerns regarding the funding available, so I just want to get some opinions from some of you from your experience.

Firstly, the lab has the necessary equipment such as Isolera, LCMS, Rotovaps etc, however the state of the lab is not great. It's quite an old lab, so the fume hoods appear to be getting quite tired. What concerned me however is that for the Isolera, the PI stated that they do not use hexane as a solvent, and instead use cyclohexane as it is cheaper. 

For my Masters, I worked in a very modern, new lab which, while crowded, was well equipped and clearly well funded. I'm not too concerned about things being old or out-of-date or having 'quirks' to them, however is the fact the researchers use 'cyclohexane' in place of 'hexane' something I should be concerned about, long-term, in terms of a consistent theme throughout the lab? I don't mean this in a chemical sense, but if I am to do a PhD in such a lab, and the PI is incapable of getting the required resources, surely my research would suffer as well.

So I'm interested in all your opinions, and whether low funded labs are fine as long as you have sufficient funds for ordering key chemicals for example. The good thing is the lab consists of fewer people, so I will have my own fumehood which is great, and there's plenty of rbfs etc. Perhaps it's just because I've previously used only modern labs, so I got spoilt by how well everything is maintained - my previous labs just had much greater organisation of things, dry solvent towers etc. There's of course nothing wrong with older labs, I'm just trying to eliminate the possibility of this interfering or impacting my PhD at a later stage.

chemistry,"As an organic chemist, I often use a rule of thumb for determining equilibrium composition of a mixture of acids and bases that depends on each species' pKa. For example, a hypothetical carboxylic acid (pKa = 5) will protonate a hypothetical amine (protonated pKa = 10) to the extent that the equilibrium constant will be K ~ 10^(10-5) = 10^5. There are circumstances when this logic seems to be at odds with other models.

For example, I read a paper earlier today that used DMAP (a nucleophilic organocatalyst) in a buffered aqueous solution. DMAP (protonated pKa 9.2) was used at 10 mM in an aqueous solution buffered to pH 8.7 by 50mM N-ethylmorpholine. Henderson-Hasselbalch would say that ~30% of the DMAP is unprotonated under these conditions, based on the solution's pH and DMAP's pKa. That all makes sense. 

However, the pKa of protonated N-ethylmorpholine is 7.7. So according to the rule of thumb I described, wouldn't you expect that protonated N-ethylmorpholine should protonate DMAP with K ~ 10^(1.5) and reduce the concentration of unprotonated DMAP (especially because the N-ethylmorpholine is in fivefold molar excess with respect to DMAP)?

Cu(s) + H2SO4(l) --&gt; CuSO4(aq) + SO2(g) + H2O(l)

This was my explanation:

&gt; Copper does not react with dilute sulfuric acid as its reduction potential is higher than that of hydrogen. Copper does not displace hydrogen from non-oxidising acids like HCl or dilute H2SO4.
But, concentrated sulfuric acid is an oxidising agent. So, when copper is heated with conc.H2SO4, a redox reaction occurs and the acid gets reduced to sulfur hydroxide.
So to answer your question, it's the molecular form (l).

This was his response:

&gt; dont think so, because only the h+ ions are involved in the acid-metal reaction. Since concentrated h2so4 is virtually molecular, therefore there are no free H+ ions. However, diluted h2so4 is completely ionised, therefore it has free H+ ions which reacts with the metal

Apologies, I’m a neuroscience PhD student not a chemist. I’ve gotten myself confused about something and was wondering if anyone could help me out. I’ve been using nicotine hydrogen tartrate salt for some experiments I’ve been doing, 25 uM (Mr = 498 g/mol). I’m comparing my data to some other papers that have used nicotine as free base in a wide range 5-50 uM (Mr = 162 g/mol). I’ve had mixed advice on the best way to compare these concentrations. Some have said to just compare them as is, so not to worry about converting them, a mole is a mole after all. Others have said that in order to compare the values correctly a correction factor should be applied, and I should convert my salt form to free base, or the free base to salt form, and compare those values. So for instance to convert my salt concentration to free base I’d apply a correction factor:

162/498 = 0.325

25 \* 0.325 = 8.125 uM

So using this approach the value I should be comparing to these free base papers is 8.125 uM, not 25 uM. 

My worry is that my conclusions will be very different depending on the approach I use. So for instance, say that my data shows that something interesting happens with 25 uM salt form, whereas another paper states that the same interesting thing happens with 10 uM free base. If I don’t convert my concentrations to free base, then it seems that different concentrations do the same thing. If I do convert it, then it states that approximately equal concentrations (8.125 vs 10 uM) do the same thing. 

I can’t seem to get a straight answer, and I honestly don’t know enough about chemistry to come to my own conclusion, both methods kind of make sense to me which has just confused me further. Any advice would be greatly appreciated.",Free base vs salt molarity,1539083514

I presume that I can carry out TLC on the crude essential oil to determine the rate at which it will separate from the other constituents, and then use this information to run column chromatography on the essential oil in a manner that guarantees clean separation of the nepetalactone. Is this correct? If so, what do I need to know in order to carry this out? I recall that it has something to do with Rf, but I'm unclear on the details. Also, what would appropriate stationary and mobile phases for the isolation of this sort of compound be? I'm aware that silica gel and hexane/ethyl acetate are pretty common. Would these work?

I’m using it for the first time today and everything is going well so far, but I was wondering if I ought to air out the flask now that around 1/5 of the solution has evaporated off and condensed. The setup I bought is one of these bad Larry’s https://www.amazon.com/LabStock-LB120-1000MK-Distillers-Distillation-Capacity/dp/B01JDBSP12/ref=zg_bs_2620831011_40?_encoding=UTF8&amp;psc=1&amp;refRID=75B3MK5QKBFMVAA21E02

Now...I’m wondering if when the vapors condense in the corkscrew elbow joint thingy, if air is transferred up the corkscrew when the pressure in the unit reaches a certain point, therefore there is no dangerous pressure build up...or vaccine created? Perhaps it’s a vaccine I am actually worried about now that I think of it...


TLDR; Basically, I have some essential oils mixed in with alcohol and I’m trying to boil the alcohol off and reclaim it, that way all that is left in the flask is water and oils. Should I be worried about a negative vaccume in the apparatus, or pressure build up, or does it work itself out on its own? The temp it’s boiling at is currently 180ish F, and the flask was about 7/10 full when I started the distillation, probably 70% is alcohol, and it’s around 1/2 full now...idk prob 45-50% alcohol now.

&amp;#x200B;

I know that a B.S. is not enough to get stable employment and that I would need a M.S. if not a P.h.D. in chemistry just to get stable employment. I am interested in and considering chemistry not only because I did well in my chemistry course in high school but because my dad was a molecular biologist and worked in research and I feel like doing a career in research could be very meaningful and I may even make a major contribution to society which may make it worth it in the end.

&amp;#x200B;

**However, I am not naive about what I am getting into!** I know that in order to do independent research or to become a tenured professor I would need a P.h.D. but I know that there are too many P.h.D.s for not only tenure-tracked and tenure positions as professors at universities but there is also an too many P.h.D.s even in industry. I also know that you are usually exploited in graduate school especially as a STEM graduate student!

Can you all please give me a list of research areas in chemistry that I can do?**

Let me make this clear that while I do know that pharmaceuticals is one of the biggest employers of chemists (and biologists) but I am not interested in that. I also know that pharmaceuticals are downsizing and off-shoring so even that is not really a viable career unless you graduate from a top 50 university! Is chemistry only mainly for pharmaceuticals?

&amp;#x200B;

I also know that based on this advice a P.h.D. (and I would say even a M.S.) in chemistry is **not** worth it unless if you go to a top 50 university and becoming a professor is **not worth it unless you go to a top 10 program.** Going to a prestigious university such as Harvard, Yale, CalTech, Stanford, MIT, or Columbia University gives you the best chance of getting a tenured professorship and even then you're likely to go teach a lower-ranked university at let's say a Public Ivy or at least a slightly lower-ranked university outside of the top 10 programs.

The commenters responding to these poor fecal-foot fellows often suggested that a) there WERE particles of dog feces remaining or b) the shoe owner was hallucinating the smell.

I'm struggling with purifying a product and I'm out of ideas. I wanted to ask you for help, hoping that a fresh perspective might give me some ideas. I've asked around in my group, but have tried everything without success. 

I'm purifying a product of a CuAAC between a PEG2000-phoshpolipid and a (click reactive) sugar phosphate. The impurities are mostly CuSO4 and sodium ascorbate along with the rest of my sugar phosphate. All of them are under 400 g/mol while my product is around 3000 g/mol (with a PEG distribution). I can see my product on MALDI-ToF but when I run UPLC-MS, even with UV detection at 206 nm that should detect the phosphate, I might see a bump but not enough to be sure about the purity. The product is soluble in chloroform but also in water if I sonicate it and form micelles. Or also forms micelles spontaneously. The impurities are fully soluble in water. 

I can't really wash my polar impurities away, since the product is amphiphilic and by definition an emulsifier and, yeah, I get mostly emulsion. I can see both product and impurities in both phases and it's just very messy. I tried precipitation/recrystallization from various solvents but solubility is very inconsistent and highly concentration and impurity dependent. It doesn't run well on silica TLC, there's a strong peak in the baseline (looks like my compound and all the reagents except the PEG2000-phospholipid, which tails up to the middle), also when I run it in a mixture of acid, water, methanol and chloroform (0,5:4,5:95 aq AcOH:MeOH:CHCl3 or similar mix, recommended from people who have worked with PEG-lipids). I tried scraping off the TLC peaks and analysing them and I could only see something like a degraded PEG distribution. I tried prep HPLC but it seemed to stick on the column, only came out when washing it with strong solvents. I care about our columns so I won't try anything like that again. 

I tried dialysis in a cartridge with a cut-off of 2000 Da, which should dialyse out my small impurities, but after 24 hours and changing the buffer (milli-Q water) 4 times there were still impurities. I have no idea why they didn't cross the membrane, maybe they associate with the surface of my micelles? I tried solid phase extraction (C8 column) but got no retention of anything. I tried size exclusion (DNA grade sephadex column) and saw some retention but an overlap of the product and impurities. Again, I have no idea why compounds with 10x difference in size were not separated. My next step is to see if someone has a better size exclusion column. I used the small ones you run with gravitation but I think a biochemist in the group has a HPLC-style instrument with SEC columns, although I'm not sure anyone has anything with a cut-off low enough, since they often work with much larger things.

chemistry,"I'm a bit confused how everything fits together. For reduced properties, when i look them up, they're only given in terms of the equations Tr=T/Tc and Pr=P/Pc. I understand that critical temperature is the temp above which a gas cannot be compressed into a liquid, and critical pressure is the minimum pressure for a gas to be compressed into a liquid at that point. So what do these two formulas tell us about reduced properties? And how does that help us solve problems about gases?

&amp;#x200B;

Compressibility factor, Z, is the ratio of the observed mass of a real gas to its ideal volume. It is 1 for ideal gases. 

&amp;#x200B;

So if you're trying to find volume of a gas that is not ideal, you can use its critical temperature and pressure to look up its compressibility factor on a chart. Then substitute the ideal gas volume to get the real volume. Also, for other problems, if Z is roughly 1, then you can just assume ideal gas behavior and work with the ideal gas equation.

&amp;#x200B;

So where do reduced properties even fit in here? Why do we need/care about them? And what is the deal with reduced volume?

Essentially my question is: if you had to choose to sacrifice one for the other, what is more important to admissions: A good letter of recommendation, or your name on a research publication?



Background:

I spent 2.5 years as an undergrad working in a synthetic chemistry research lab under the guidance of the PI and a grad student, and completed an honors research thesis on my work. Now, I don't want to imply that I lifted the world on my own shoulders, but I definitely wasn't the quintessential ""barnacle"" that many undergraduate chemistry researchers are described as. I was in that lab nearly every day, also on weekends, running reactions, purifications, analysis, writing, etc. I worked my ass off. I didn't get paid for it, except during the summer months when I worked there. When I was graduating, I was told that the lab would continue working on our topic and then publish a paper soon after, on which I would gain supporting authorship credit. This was important to me because I knew I wanted to go to graduate school, and I was always told that having your name on a publication is a very beneficial piece of your application. A year ticked by, and I was told they were still working on it. In the meantime, I saw that they published a different paper that contained some of the molecules that I synthesized- but it was aimed at a totally different application. I thought to myself, ""hmm this seems odd, why wouldn't I be given credit for this? But, no worries, they will publish the work I was a part of eventually and give me credit."" Another year went by, and still nothing.

Today I contacted the PI asking if he would write me a letter of recommendation for my upcoming MSTP application (he said yes), and I also inquired about the publication efforts. He said the lab is finally getting ready to publish the project I was a part of. However, I will not be included as an author, as ""practically none of"" the experiments I was working on yielded products containing the precise qualities that were sought after in the goal of the research project (for our purposes, you can think of this as impurities in the final product). This strikes me as an odd thing to say, as the thesis I published 2 years ago shows data that contests this point about impurities, and at the time we all treated the results as a measure of success- we got what we were trying to get. Further, I spoke with the PI a few months ago and he indicated that I was going to get credit when they were submitting the manuscript.There was no talk of these unfortunate impurities.

Now I am at a loss as to what to do- do I try to contest being excluded and risk losing a good letter of recommendation? Or do I accept my losses and prioritize the letter of recommendation? I consider this professor to be a valuable letter-writer for my application, since I worked his lab for so long and it's my most substantial research experience. Is there even a recourse for me to contest being excluded? I still possess all my lab notebooks showing the work I did for those 2.5 years. I know this kind of thing happens in academia, but come on- from my point of view the professor's claim is practically indefensible, unless they totally abandoned the work I was a part of and devised a radically new approach to the goal. While possible, I know the work pace of the lab and it seems highly unlikely that they would be ready to publish now if this were the case.

But one thing is bothering me right now- the names of oxyanions. I know that you can usually figure out the formula of an oxyanion by knowing how many Oxygen atoms are in the oxyanion with the -ate suffix (e.g. knowing how many Oxygen atoms are in Sulfate clues you in to the formulas for Persulfate, Sulfite, and Hyposulfite). That’s fairly straightforward. 

But is there any rhyme or reason for why the -ate suffix is applied to oxyanions with 4 Oxygen atoms for most elements (that I examined anyway) and 3 Oxygen atoms for others? I read in some places that it was mostly based on the oxyanion that is most common in nature, but there has to be a more systematic system, right? And if not, why is it that the -ate oxyanions for halogen elements seem to always have only 3 Oxygen atoms (along with Carbon and Manganese)?

Since yesterday I'm going to university. I had to move, rent a home, furnish it, etc. After all that was done, I have to admit that I feel like I'm at the wrong place. I picked one of the best universities, and have classes from 8am to 6pm, and then assignments and things to go over.

I picked Chemistry not because I like it, but because I was good at it without learning. And because of litle free time I have, I can't do the things I enjoyed before (3 hour gaming sessions after coming from school at 2pm, coding or scripting random things, chatting with friends, looking up things on the internet intensively, redditing...)

Now quitting isn't an option as I have already made a huge investment, but I don't know if I will ever get over not doing those things I love. And I also feel like I have lost my identity, as I can't do what I love, and the things that defined me in highschool (good in Chemistry, Maths, etc.) now apply to many people.

Last but not least, I left behind all my friends, and my girlfriend. And it's hard for me to make good friends. What I mean is: I have no problems making regular friends I can go out with, but I prefer to have a few which I know I can trust and who really care about me, and finding those takes a lot of time.

But yeah, all in all, I guess the 10 hour university is killing me the most. No idea if that's the norm, but I really feel like I'm unable to do what I like the most.

chemistry,"Hi everyone,

Just wondering whether someone can confirm that my basic understanding of laser emission is correct. In short, this is how I understand it;

1. Active medium is pumped to achieve population inversion
2. Spontaneous emission occurs in the inverted medium, producing radiation with a profile such as the one shown at the top of the attached figure (spontaneous emission band)
3. The spontaneous emission is released into the cavity
4. Only the longitudinal modes of an intensity above the laser threshold are able to traverse the cavity and pass through the medium once again to be amplified
5. The radiation passing back through the medium is amplified by inducing stimulated emission

I am almost entirely self taught as far as Organic Chemistry goes and have read thousands of research papers in my lifetime. The culminating point I want to make here is that I have made several of my own discoveries when experimenting in the lab over the years, many involving novel synthesis techniques, or green chemistry techniques.

These are things that if published would have no negative effect on our business activities, but merely make the lives of other chemists around the world easier.

chemistry,"Hi,

I was taking notes in class and I wrote that if nodal surfaces exist in an anti-bonding molecular orbital it's because of a repulsion between the two atomic orbitals. So that leads me to think that, since there are electrons in the AO whose wave function is positive, there are some positive particles in the AO whose wave function is negative (meaning that it has no electrons in it) ? But then again you don't fill up orbitals with anything but electrons, so what would induce that repulsion?

im currently working on a project using a colour reaction to measure a concentration of a certain compund.

The colour compound is colorless until it is degraded by a reaction. The reaction happens spontenous over time, making the expiration date of the kit very low. We are trying to add antioxidants to preserve the colour agent. is there a rule of thumb or regarding the addition of antioxidants?

chemistry,"Today I wound up telling an old anecdote to a colleague, and it made me realize that I never learned the chemistry behind our impromptu experiment. I was hoping someone here could finally tell me what we wound up doing...

&amp;#x200B;

Briefly: We had a fish farm growing up in Western Massachusetts, mostly trout, but with some tilapia. We ordered some bass for our fee-for-fishing pond, and since their water was less acidic than ours, we were told to prep the pond with some crushed limestone. We did some back-of-the-envelope calculation about Ph, and the volume of water, and ended up dumping something like 120 pounds of it all around the pond in preparation.

The bass arrive, and immediately start floating upside down. We finally get the bright idea to run find a Ph meter, and the water was absurdly basic--I don't remember what the number was, but it was off the charts high. We go over our calculations again, and can't find anything wrong (as more and more fish start floating).

Then we notice that the bags weren't of crushed limestone, but of pure lime. Whoops.

Fortunately, the greenhouse project on our land had a lot of acid (hydrochloric, I believe), so we got it and ran around the pond throwing it in (diluted in 5 gallon buckets), pouring it on the piles of lime still left by the shore. Much fizzing commenced, but eventually we got the Ph down to where it should be. Amazingly, almost all of the fish lived. 

My stepfather (who ran the farm) insisted that there would be no side effects or issues, that it just let off heat and fizz and water. Once the pond water got well-mixed, there would be no consequences. I do think we didn't have people fish in that particular pond for a week or so.

Was my stepfather full of it? What is actually released when you mix lime and hydrochloric acid? And fish?

TL;DR--dumped lime and then hydrochloric acid in our pond, and then let people fish there. ",A question from a long-ago incident involving acid and lime,1536707797
chemistry,"Hi, Reddit, I'm a high schooler in AP Chemistry, and I had some questions about electron pair shapes 

(should be fairly elementary for you pros)

&amp;#x200B;

Anyways, here they are:

So, apparently, O2's electron pairs form a triagonal planar shape (no idea what that is, but it's like a triangle in a plane I'm guessing). And NH3, it's triagonal pyramidal because it's a triangular pyramid, right? And lastly, something like CH4 is tetrahedral.

But, then what's the difference between triagonal pyramidal and tetrahedral? Aren't they both triangular pyramids? Or am I being too mathematical?

chemistry,"Hi all

I'm a keen 3D printer and am interested in the idea that 3D printers can partially self replicate (RepRap project). Currently this self replication is practically limited to 3D printers which print using ABS, PLA, PETG and other plastics. There are printers that use lasers but they can't produce much of their own parts and metal printers are all kinds of expensive.

Currently there are a small number of designs for 3D printers which print a paste (most often clay) rather than extruding hot plastic. 

I recently found out about metal clays [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Metal\_clay](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Metal_clay) which are used for things like jewellery, they are a liquid, a binder and a metal which when fired produces an almost pure metal.

This got me thinking, could you combine 3D printing a paste + a kiln to create structural parts for a 3D printer? 

Would it be possible to produce a metal clay which would be strong enough (and cheap enough) to build structural parts for a 3D printer from? Obviously there will be some shrinkage but this should be manageable. 

One consideration is the temperature needed to create the finished object, affordable kilns on Amazon for hobbyists appear to go up to around 1000 C (1832 F). 

Thanks very much",How could you create a metal clay that could be fired to produce an object strong enough to build equipment?,1536696440

Molecules in the air are free to move, vibrate and tumble, but confine them in small nanotubes or cavities and they lose a lot of motion. The total loss in motion has big implications for the ability to capture CO2 from the air, convert biomass molecules into biofuels, or to separate natural gas, all of which use nanomaterials with small tubes and pores.

Researchers from the Catalysis Center for Energy Innovation headquartered at the University of Delaware arrived at their breakthrough when thinking about squeezing molecules into tight spaces. In the air, molecules can move up, down, and into space (three dimensions), but in a nanotube it was not clear if molecules can only move in one direction (through the tube) or two directions (on the surface of the tube). Similarly, molecules can rotate and spin in three ways, but the tube edges can prevent some or all of this motion. The amount of lost rotation was the unknown quantity.

 “Our approach was to separate out molecular tumbling and rotating from movement in position,” said Omar Abdelrahman, a co-author of the study who is a University of Massachusetts Amherst chemical engineering assistant professor and Catalysis Center for Energy Innovation researcher. “We discovered that all molecules when put into nano-cages lose the same amount of movement in position, but the amount of rotating and spinning depended highly on the structure of the nano-cage”.

The team connected molecular motion to the quantity of entropy, which combines all aspects of molecular motion into a single number. Molecules lose different amounts of entropy when they access the inside of nanoporous spaces, but it has not been clear how the structure of those nanospaces impacted the change in motion and loss in entropy.
